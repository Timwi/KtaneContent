                <h2>On the Subject of Passport Control</h2>
                <p class="flavour-text">Congratulations.<br>The October Labor Lottery is complete.<br>Your name was pulled.<br>Glory to Arstotzka, glory greatest country!</p>

                <!--Intro to module-->
                <br>
                <h3>What is this place?</h3>
                <p>Good day citizen, it appears that your name was rolled on the October Labor Lottery.
                What does that mean you ask? Ohh nothing fancy, just a brand new position as a passport inspector!<br>
                What was that? <span class="bold">“What do I do?”</span> it’s simple, really, all you need to do is check the rules (updated daily)
                and then give each passenger a stamp of approval or denial as needed.<br>
                Your quota is 3 successful passages. Reach that and you’re free to go home for the day.</p>
                <!--Short explanation on how to function-->
                <br>
                <h3>How to operate the passport booth?</h3>
                <p>The passport booth’s most prominent features are the displays and the stampers.<br>
                The top display will show the passenger’s passport information, the bits you’ll need are just the name, ethnicity, DoB and the passport’s expiration date.<br>
                Next up is the bottom display, it’s very simple and easy to use, all it does is show you if the passenger is departing or arriving<br>
                Finally, the stampers, very simple design, very easy to use.</p>
                <h5>How to use stamp:</h5>
                    <ol>
                        <li>Choose stamp</li>
                        <li>Put hand over stamp</li>
                        <li>Press stamp</li>
                        <li>Job’s done!</li>
                    </ol>

                <!--Rule determination-->
                <h3>Rules:</h3>
                <p style="margin-bottom: 0; padding-bottom: 0;">Now you might be asking yourself, <span class="bold">“But Mr. Instructor, where do I find the rules you talked about?”</span> So let me show you<br>
                The rules are sent each day in an encrypted manner. Namely, a board with a few ports, batteries, varying indicators and a serial number.<br>
                First of all is the date. The date is seperated into three parts, day, month and year.
                    <ul style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0">
                        <li>The first digit of the day is the alphanumeric value of the 1st character in the serial #, mod 3.<br>
                        The second digit is the alphanumeric value of the 2nd character, mod 10. If the day is zero, set it to one</li>
                        <li>The month is calculated by taking the sum of the 3rd and 4th characters, mod 12 + 1.</li>
                        <li>The year is found by using the 5th character mod 10 as the tens digit and the 6th character mod 10 as the units digit.<br>
                        After that is done, mod the result by 30. The resulting year will be <span class="bold">20XX</span>, where XX is the number you calculated</li>
                    </ul>
                Next scan over the serial # once again, if there are at least 3 occurrences of the letters in ARSTOTZKA, then only Arstotzkan citizens are allowed to pass.<br>
                Furthermore if the sum of all the digits in the serial # evaluates to 18 or higher only citizens over the age of 18 are allowed to pass.
                Last but not least if there are at least 3 batteries and a port plate containing a parallel AND a serial port you must approve only those who seek entry into our glorious country,<br>
                if there are 2 or fewer batteries and a lit indicator labeled SND, you must approve only people who seek to leave our glorious nation. Otherwise, pay no attention to destination.
                </p>
                <h3 style="margin-top: 0; padding-top: 0;">RULES EXCEPTIONS:</h3>
                <p>Very important to know, nation also has secret codes for events.<br>
                Unlit indicator labeled BOB, lit indicator labeled CAR and a PS/2 port means facility on lockdown, nobody enters, nobody leaves.<br>
                Lit indicator labeled BOB, lit indicator labeled CAR and lit indicator labeled NSA means important people pass through. All are allowed passage.</p>
                <span class="bold">NOTE: MAKE SURE TO CHECK THE EXPIRATION DATE, IN CASE OF OUT OF DATE PASSPORT DENY PASSAGE EXCEPT IN CASE OF SPECIAL INSTRUCTIONS.</span>
                <span class="bold">NOTE: ALLOWING/DENYING PASSAGE WRONGFULLY WILL RESULT IN A CITATION!</span>
                <h3><span class="bold">GLORY TO ARSTOTZKA</span></h3><h3><span class="bold">GLORY GREATEST COUNTRY</span></h3>
