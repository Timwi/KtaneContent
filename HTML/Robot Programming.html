                    <h2>On the Subject of Robot Programming</h2>
                    <p class="flavour-text">Every kids fantasy job is now your adult nightmare. Just try not to ‘crash’ the program.</p>
                    
					<p>This module has 4 directional arrows, a big and small display, and a reset and start button. The reset and start buttons are labelled R and S respectively, and a maze that is only visible to the defuser. Your task as the expert is to determine which behavior each robot has. This is done using the tree of options below.</p>
					<p>The names of the robots are assigned left to right from the defuser’s perspective, starting with the top of the list of names down to the bottom of the list.</p>

                    <p>R.O.B will follow your commands perfectly.</p>
					<p>HAL will do the complete opposite of your commands.</p>
					<p>R2D2 will alternate between the personalita of R.O.B and HAL, starting with R.O.B.</p>
					<p>Fender will move according to the serial number. Fender will look at the next position of the serial number after each command he gets. If he was looking at a digit last, he will act like R.O.B. If he was looking at a letter last, he will act like HAL.</p>
					<p>Now that you’ve determined which robot is which, now you can begin inputting commands. Before you do this, however, there are a few things you must keep track of.</p>
					<p>The commands will not affect the robots until the start button is pressed. The screen is very tiny, and therefore only shows the last 3 inputted commands.</p>
					<p>There is an LED that will change every time you input a command. This LED will be the color one of the robots. When you input the command, the command will be sent to the robot that is the color of the LED. You can press the button that is the color of the robot south of the display so that they cannot receive any more commands. Be careful, because you cannot unlock a robot until you either press start or reset the entire command sequence.</p>
					<p>Once you have inputted the entire command chain, press the start button labelled “S”. If a robot does not reach their colored square, or runs into a wall or another robot, the module will strike.</p>
					<p>Upon a strike, the robot in which crashed will return to the square it was in before the crash, but no robot’s coordinates will be reset. The small display will show the reason of the crash (OOC means “Out of Commands”, OOB means “Out of Boundaries”.), afterwards showing the colors of the robots in reading order, as if they were in their starting position. The position of the serial number Fender was on before the crash occurred will also show. If Fender or R2D2 crashed, they will act how they acted before the crash. (This does not apply if they are not responsible for the crash.)</p>
