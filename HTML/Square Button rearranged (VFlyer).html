                <h2>On the Subject of The Square Button</h2>
                <p class="flavour-text">It’s a brilliantly disguised imposter foiled only by a <span class="strikethrough">single</span> couple mistake(s): It’s the wrong shape. And people fall for the wording traps.</p>
                <p>Follow these rules in the order they are listed. When the instructions state to tap the button, this can be done by pressing the button and then immediately releasing the button.</p>
                <ol>
                    <li>If the button is blue and the number of AA batteries is larger than the number of D batteries, hold the button and refer to "Releasing a Held Button".</li>
                    <li>Otherwise, if the button is yellow or blue...<ul>
                        <li>...and has as at least as many letters on the label as the highest number in the serial, tap the button.</li>
                        <li>...and the label states a colour (Jade, Indigo, Purple, Maroon), hold the button and refer to "Releasing a Held Button".</li>
                        </ul></li>
                    <li>Otherwise, if the button has no label, tap the button when the two seconds digits on the timer match.</li>
                    <li>Otherwise, if the button is not dark grey and the number of letters on the label is larger than the number of lit indicators, tap the button.</li>
                    <li>Otherwise, if there are at least 2 unlit indicators and the serial contains a vowel, tap the button.</li>
                    <li>Otherwise, if no other rule applies, hold the button and refer to "Releasing a Held Button".</li>
                </ol>

                <h3>Releasing a Held Button</h3>
                <p>If you start holding the button down, a coloured LED will light up on the right side of the button case. Based on its colour, follow the rules below:</p>
                <ul>
                    <li><em>Cyan:</em> Release when the two seconds digits add up to 7.</li>
                    <li><em>Orange:</em> Release when the two seconds digits add up to 3 or 13.</li>
                    <li><em>Other:</em> Release when the two seconds digits add up to 5.</li>
                </ul>
                <p>If the LED is flickering, follow these rules instead:</p>
                <ul>
                    <li><em>Cyan:</em> Release when the total time remaining in seconds is a multiple of 7. (Example times that meet this condition: 1:10, 2:20, 3:30, 4:40, 5:50, 7:00)</li>
                    <li><em>Orange:</em> Release when the seconds timer displayed is either a prime number (2, 3, 5, 7, 11, 13, 17, 19, 23, 29, 31, 37, 41, 43, 47, 53, 59) or 0.</li>
                    <li><em>Other:</em> Release when the two seconds digits add up to a number one less than a multiple of 4. (3, 7, 11, 15, ...)</li>
                </ul>
