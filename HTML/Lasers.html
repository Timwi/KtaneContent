                <ul>
                    <li>The module will initially show 9 closed hatches in a 3×3 grid.  Each hatch is numbered a digit from 1–9.</li>
                    <li>Open 7 hatches to reveal 7 colored lasers in the order listed in the below table. At each stage, choose
                        a laser that is not forbidden based on the rule listed in the table.</li>
                    <li>Choosing a forbidden laser will earn a strike and reset the module to its initial state.</li>
                    <li>You cannot re-use an already opened hatch.  The numbers on the hatches do not change position.  Make it through all 7 stages to defuse the module.</li>
                    <li>Based on the hatches chosen in earlier stages, it is possible to reach a later stage in which no remaining hatches are valid.
                        However, there is always at least one path that can be taken from start to finish that will not lead to such a situation.</li>

                    <tr><td>Red</td><td>Any laser in the row containing the laser equal to the digital root* of the sum of all laser numbers in the topmost row.</td></tr>
                    <tr><td>Orange</td><td>Any laser orthogonally** adjacent to the laser taken in the red stage.</td>
                    <tr><td>Yellow</td><td>Any laser in the column originally containing the laser equal to the digital root* of the sum of all laser numbers originally in the 2 rightmost columns.</td>
                    <tr><td>Green</td><td>Any laser NOT diagonally adjacent to the laser taken in the yellow stage.</td>
                    <tr><td>Blue</td><td>Any laser in the row or the column originally containing the laser equal to the digital root* of the (number of whole minutes originally in the bomb plus one).</td>
                    <tr><td>Purple</td><td>Any laser that shares parity (that is, matches even/odd condition) with the number of modules originally on the bomb.</td></tr>
                    <tr><td>White</td><td>Any laser originally adjacent to the laser taken in the blue stage.</td></tr>
                </table>

                <p>* Digital root is calculated by adding the sum of the digits of a number, and repeating until left with a single number. For example, 1356 = 1+3+5+6 = 15; 15 = 1+5 = 6, so the digital root of 1356 is 6.
                <p>** Lasers are orthogonally adjacent if they are to the left/right/up/down of one another (adjacent, not counting diagonals).
