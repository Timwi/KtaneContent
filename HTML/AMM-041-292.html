                <p>If any voltage is not in acceptable range, that means installed wires on this circuit have wrong total resistance. You should connect another circuit to this one (via serial or parallel connection) to adjust resistance. This may be not necessary. Replacing existing circuit will lead to unpredictable condition, so <b>it is not an option</b>.<br/>If any voltage is in range 0-0.2V, that means this circuit is empty and <u>needs</u> replacement with new circuit.</p>

                <p>If AMM's battery charge (BTR%) is less than 5, you will need to charge him. There are 2 options:</p>
                <ul>
                    <li>You have to bring him somewhere to charge. Hold Q <u>for at least 5 seconds</u> to pick him up, after that the process of finding a charge source will start. It'll take 5 minutes or less.
                    <p style="font-size:70%; color:#c0c0c0">Configuration of charging will be told. Wire with the first letter of the configuration should be connected with red wire of the tail. Wire with second letter - to yellow, with third letter - to green, and with fourth letter - to blue.<br/>Notice that you have to input the digits in order that is defined in the bottom of the module.</p></li>
                    <li>You have to bring him batteries that you can find solving other modules.
                    <p style="font-size:70%; color:#c0c0c0">Configuration of charging will be written on a battery. First letter of the configuration assigned to first digit in configuration. Same as second and third letters/digits. The remaining wire is assigned to fourth digit.<br/>Notice that you have to input the digits in order that is defined in the bottom of the module.</p></li>

                <h3>2. Gathering parts</h3>
                <p class="comment">Is this some another dumb semi-boss module?!</p>
                <p>In order to fix AMM, you'll have to find spare parts. Solving other modules will grant you some parts. <u>Notice:</u> solving all <a href="../More/Ignore Table.html#mod=amm041292">non-ignored modules</a> will guaranterely give you all neccessary parts, but getting them earlier still may be possible. Usually, module requires for 0.5% solved modules, in some cases module can be solved right away.</p>

                <p>To open your inventory, press I.</p>
                <p>Use ↑/W and ↓/S keys to navigate through inventory. To use the item, press ENTER if the item is wire/resistor or battery or 0-3 if item is not wire/resistor/battery. Pressing 0-3 will use this item on corresponding issue (i.e. pressing 2 while Oilcan is selected will oil up BS2). Be aware that you have to do it in correct timing.</p>

                <p>Remember: after successfully fixing any issue, average amplitude <u>will change</u>. You'll have to recalculate all c<sub>i</sub> and d<sub>i</sub>.</p>
                <p>To adjust resistances on circuits, use <u>any</u> wire or resistor. This will open Wire Composer menu. Remember, you will have 3 serial connections of resistors, and 5 parallel connections on each serial one. When you're done, module will ask you "Which circuit needs to be adjusted?". Press a digit 1-5 to select HVOs and 6-0 to select LVOs, and press ENTER to confirm. If circuit already has non-infinite resistance, module will ask you "How do you want to connect it?". Press 1 to connect it as serial connection, press 0 to connect it as parallel connection.</p>
                <p>To find current resistance of the circuit use formula: R = R<sub>0</sub> * (U / U<sub>0</sub>), where U - current voltage, U<sub>0</sub> - nominal voltage, R<sub>0</sub> - nominal resistance.</p>
                <p>Resistance of parallel connection: 1 / (1 / R<sub>1</sub> + 1 / R<sub>2</sub> + ...). Resistance of serial connection: R<sub>1</sub> + R<sub>2</sub> + ... .</p>

                <h3>4. Tracking other values</h3>
                <p class="comment">Don't you think it's all that easy!</p>
                <p>[View Voltages] screen will have two additional values: BTR% (battery level) and AEAN (antennae angle).</p>
                <p>AEAN variable is used to track your progress on module completion.</p>
                    <ul>
                        <li>If you do repairs correctly, AEAN will decrease. If you hurt AMM in any way (incorrect resistance, wrong timings, dropping AMM while picking up...), AEAN will increase.</li>
                        <li>If AEAN goes above 120.0 at any moment, AMM will gather all the power together, and run away. Not that he'll run away far, but he will hurt himself to unrepairable condition, <b>RENDERING THIS MODULE AS UNSOLVABLE FROM NOW ON</b>.</li>
                        <li>If all critical issues are fixed and AEAN is 20.0 or lower, module will solve in a short time.</li>
                        <li>If AEAN is more than 20.0 after fixing critical issues, you'll have to fix non-critical ones until AEAN becomes 20.0 or lower.</li>
                        <li>If after fixing all issues AEAN is more than 20.0, module still will solve.</li>
                    </ul>
                
                <p><i>After fixing him, he thanks you for help. Who knows what would happen to this poor guy?</i></p>
                <p><i>Saying goodbye, you continue on your wandering through these factories. When does it end?</i></p>
