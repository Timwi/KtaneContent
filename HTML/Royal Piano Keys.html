                <h2>On the Subject of Royal Piano Keys</h2>
                <p class="flavour-text">nanoraaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaa</p>
                <p>You are one of the many knights, serving for the princess of sweets in the country, and today it is your turn to serve her.</p>
                <p>For the main part, you must fulfill her two desires: Food and Entertainment.</p>
                <p>Refer to the instructions below if you don't want your head chopped off.</p>
                
                <h3>Food</h3>
                <p>The offerings for food are the ones displayed in the screen of the module.</p>
                <p>But you know one thing for sure - despite the abundance of sweets in the kingdom, the princess actually likes those ball-shaped snacks filled with minced octopus and other stuff, refered to her as "takoyaki".</p>
                <p>And of course, some knights simply didn't know that and thought offering other sweets is the best choice.</p>
                <p>Your job is to yell at the knights to change the food given until they are all "takoyakis". Pressing the food given changes it.</p>
                <p>If you accidentally tell the knights to change the "takoyakis" into something else instead, they will all be confused and not change it, leaving a strike on your own fatal mistake.</p>
                
                <h3>Entertainment</h3>
                <p>Usually this is the hardest part when serving the princess, but fortunately she only demands a piano performance this time.</p>
                <p>Still, she is quite annoyed on how long it took the offerings to arrive. How annoyed she is can be determined by how many times you had to change the food.</p>
                <p>If you had to changed the food...<p>
                <ul>
                    <li>0 to 3 times, then she is still pretty calm.</li>
                    <li>4 to 7 times, then she is currently pouting.</li>
                    <li>8 to 11 times, then she is really annoyed.</li>
                    <li>12 to 15 times, then she is very mad at this point.</li>
                </ul>
                <p>The ranges are all inclusive.</p>

            <div class="page-content">
                <p>To have her calm down, you must do your best on playing the piano to her. The melody she is currently in the mood for is highly based on the number of "takoyakis" offered:</p>
                <ul>
                    <li>If the number of "takoyakis" in the leftmost set are larger than the other two, then you should play Godzilla's Theme.</li>
                    <li>Otherwise, if the total sum of "takoyakis" ranges from 6 to 9, inclusive, then you should play A Town with an Ocean's View.</li>
                    <li>Otherwise, if the number of "takoyakis" in the middle set is less than 3, then you should play Take Me Home, Country Roads.</li>
                    <li>Otherwise, if the sum of the middle and rightmost sets of "takoyakis" is larger than 8, then you should play Shiny Smily Story.</li>
                    <li>Otherwise, if the number of "takoyakis" in each set are the same, then you should play Pirates of the Carribean.</li>
                    <li>Otherwise, if the number of "takoyakis" in the rightmost set is 2, 3, or 5, you should play Let it Be.</li>
                    <li>Otherwise, if none of the sets contain exactly 4 "takoyakis", you should play Für Elise.</li>
                    <li>Otherwise, you should play Kiseki Knot.</li>
                </ul>
                <p>The princess' mood determines how long your performance should be.</p>
                <ul>
                    <li>If she is calm, only one measure is needed.</li>
                    <li>If she pouts, then you would have to play two measures.</li>
                    <li>If she is annoyed, three measures are needed to calm her down.</li>
                    <li>If she is mad, you would have to play four measures to satisfy her completely.</li>
                </ul>
                <p>After doing everything correctly, the princess should be satisfied, and offer a solve of this module, saving your life for another day.</p>
                <p>If you have no idea how to play the piano, fortunate for you that all sets of melodies and a piano guide could all be found in Appendix NAAA.</p>
                <p>Be noted that attempting to play the piano before the food is complete, or playing additional notes after a solve, all would result in a strike, as playing it without authorization would annoy the princess.</p>
                <p>You should know this by heart, that playing a wrong key would also result a strike, but the princess would insist you to continue instead, starting from where your mistake is.</p>
