                        <p class="flavour-text">Order! Order! Order!</p>
                        
						<p><strong>WARNING! WARNING! This is a Boss Module! This means that it depends on either solves or a timer and if anything is done wrong it can seriously screw with your bomb, you have been warned...</strong></p>
						
                        <p>This module has a notebook themed display which shows a module's name. It also has a switch towards the top right and a button that says "Continue?" in the bottom left.</p>
						
						<p>To solve this module the defuser must solve every single module in a certain order dictated by the module. The module on the notebook display is the next one to be solved, and it will update to show the next module when the "Continue?" button is pressed. But be warned, the switch needs to be in a certain position before the "Continue?" button is pressed, which is determined in the table below. A list of other modules that Organization ignores (i.e. they don't show up ever in an Organization's order and can be solved on their own time without penalty) called <strong>Ignored Modules</strong> is on Page 2. If more than one Organization is on the bomb, Then all Organizations will auto-solve.</p>
						
						<p>If the defuser presses continue when the displayed module is not solved or the position of the switch is in the wrong position when "Continue?" is pressed, a strike will be recorded and the module will NOT reset. A strike will also be recorded if any module is solved that is not on an Organization's display and that module not on the display will be removed as future possibility.</p>
