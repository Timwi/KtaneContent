                <h2>On the Subject of Pathfinders</h2>
                <p class="flavour-text">Now entering: Lethal Lava Land. To tourists wishing to see the volcano, please take care with where you walk.</p>

                <p>You are a tourist, going to see the volcano in an igneous area. The path to the volcano has some levitating slabs of rock above a stream of lava and some may have fallen into the lava below.</p>
                <p>Each slab has a number on it and stepping onto a slab will cause its number to decrease by 1. If a slab’s number decreases to 0, it will fall into the lava below after you step off of it.</p>
                <p>You could just take a direct path to the other side, however the person behind you in line has been giving you a bit of an earful, so <strong>you’re planning to make all of the slabs fall into the lava to cut off their route to the volcano.</strong></p>
                <p>Also, to reduce the likelihood of someone falling into the lava stream, <strong>the tourism group forbids turning around on the slabs or moving diagonally.</strong></p>
                <p>You are on the top left slab and you can get onto the other side of the stream at the bottom right. <strong>You must end at the bottom right to solve the module.</strong></p>
                <p>Luckily, you can reset the positions of all of the slabs by using the reset pillar to the right. This will also reset your position back to the top left again.</p>
                <p>This module can’t strike, so don’t worry about messing up or anything.</p>
                <h3>Keyboard Support</h3>

                <p>This module has keyboard support, meaning that you can use your keyboard to move and reset. You can move using WASD or the arrow keys and reset with R.</p>
