                <h2>On the Subject of The Binary Light</h2>
                <p class="flavour-text">Are you absolutely sure this is the right light?</p>
                <p><i>See <b>Appendix: The Light</b> of <a href="../HTML/The%20Light.html">The Light</a> for help identifying the various versions of The Light.</i></p>
                <p>
                    This module presents you with a series of True or False statements about the bomb. Tap the Light to turn on a white light (True) or turn it off (False), and long press to submit your answer. If the Light isn't toggling between a white light and off every tap, you're looking at a different module.
                </p>
                <p>
                    In the table below, starting from the left, find the first condition along the top that's true for your bomb. That's your starting column. Then do the same for rows, starting from the top. The intersection of the two is your starting question.
                </p>
                <p>
                    After each question, move one cell to the right if you answered False, or down if you're already at the rightmost edge. If you answered True, move one cell down, or right if you're already at the bottom edge.
                </p>
                <p>
                    The module is solved once you answer the question at the bottom right corner.
                </p>
                <p class="note">If at any point a question's answer is indeterminate, just answer False.</p>
