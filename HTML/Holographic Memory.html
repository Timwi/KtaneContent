                <p>This module consists of two screens and a 4&#x00d7;4 grid of tiles.</p>
                <p>Each tile has two sides with a unique image on each:</p>
                <ul><li>A light side where the background is brighter than the image.</li>
                <li>A dark side where the image is brighter than the background.</li></ul>
                <p>Only one side is visible at a time. Tilt the module to reveal the other.</p>
                <p>Once every image has been memorised, press any tile to start up the module.<br>All images will disappear from the grid and the two screens will display a pair of images from the grid.<br>Only one tile should be pressed per stage. In order to figure out which:</p>
                <ol><li>If the display is a number, substitute an image from the corresponding previous stage:
                <ul><li>If the number is solid, substitute the image that was selected at that stage.</li>
                <li>If the number is empty, substitute the image that was displayed on the other screen at that stage.</li></ul></li>
                <li>The column of the required tile is the same as the column of the image displayed on the top screen.</li>
                <li>The row of the required tile is the same as the row of the image displayed on the left screen.</li>
                <li>The tile must display the correct side when it is selected:
                <ul><li>If both displayed images are from the same side of their respective tiles, the required tile must also display that side.</li>
                <li>Otherwise, the required tile must display the opposite side from the previously selected tile.</li></ul></li></ol>
                <p>If an incorrect tile or incorrect side is selected, the module will reset, revealing the images on the grid once again.</p>
