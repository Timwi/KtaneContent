<div class="flavour-text">How long can such a task really take?</div>
<ul>
<li>Initially, the module will be in an <i>Off</i> state. To initialize the module, click on the static. This will put the module in <i>Warm-Up</i> mode.<p></p>

</li><li>While in <i>Warm-Up</i>, the module will show a line with a mini-game name, and a clock ticking upwards. Clicking the static at this point will put the module into <i>Gameplay</i> mode. The mini-game name listed will inform what set of rules the module will use after entering <i>Gameplay</i>.

</li><li>Once the module has entered <i>Gameplay</i>, the timer will start ticking down, from whatever time it showed when <i>Warm-Up</i> was ended**. When the timer expires the module will be checked.  If any input was wrong or incomplete, the module will strike; otherwise, a win will be recorded.  Upon the third win, the module will disarm.  After any other win, the module will go back into <i>Warm-Up</i> automatically.

</li><li>In <i>Gameplay</i>, the module will display a single digit number in the top, and six buttons displaying unique digits.  Based on what mini-game name is being played, one of five sets of rules will apply. For each mini-game, press all the buttons following the rules until each button/number has been pressed once.  <b>If any number to be pressed is not on the module, skip to the next number that would need to be pressed.</b>
</li></ul>

*In all mini-games except Nuisance Numbers, the display can/will change after each button press.<br>

**After earning wins, the clock will count up at normal speed, but DOWN at a faster pace.  It represents full seconds at 0 wins, 3/4 seconds at 1 win, and 1/2 seconds at 2 wins.</div>
