                    <h2>On the Subject of Steam Selector</h2>
                    <p class="flavour-text">Yeah, that's right. Everyone's favourite module just got a sequel.</p>
                    On the module you see:
                    <ul>
                        <li>A display with a question on it</li>
                        <li>Three buttons pointing left, right and up</li>
                        <li>A submit button (enter)</li>
                    </ul>
                    If you don't, you either:
                    <ul>
                        <li>Clicked on the wrong manual :P</li>
                        <li>Have a BSOD screen on the module. If this is the case, that means, you've started to game outside of Steam. Press the last line to solve the module.</li>
                    </ul>
                    <p>You need to answer 3 questions, and the module will solve. If you get one wrong, the whole module resets.</p>
                    <p>Questions can be either one of the followings:</p>
                    <ul>
                        <li>Who is the Xth on the list of your Steam friends sorted by {sorting method}?</li>
                        <li>From whom have your received your Xth last message on Steam?**</li>
                        <li>What is the Xth letter/digit of the Yth last message you've received on Steam?**</li>
                        <li>Who does this avatar belong to?*</li>
                        <li>Have you unlocked the "{achievement name}" achievement?</li>
                        <li>In/On which year/month/day have you unlocked the "{achievement name}" achievement?</li>
                        <li>When have you unlocked the "{achievement name}" achievement? (hour/minute)</li>
                        <li>How many friends do you have on Steam?</li>
                        <li>Please select the avatar of {user}!</li>
                    </ul>
                    <p>Sorting methods can be one of the following:</p>
                    <ul>
                        <li>Alphabetically (A-Z)</li>
                        <li>Alphabetically (Z-A)</li>

                        <li>Steam level (High-Low)</li>
                    </ul>
                    <p>When sorting by Steam levels, sort the ties alphabetically (A-Z).</p>
                    <p>To select the answer, use the Left/Right buttons and press the Enter button to submit your choice.</p>
                    <p><strong>When given a question, the button pointing upwards might start flashing.</strong> Clicking on it will reveal extra instructions about answering. Use the left/right buttons to cycle through the pages here.</p>
                    <p class="flavour-text">*The module will show the avatar of the user. If multiple users have the same avatar, either can be used.</p>
                    <p class="flavour-text">**Will only be asked about messages you've received after the game has started. Emojis are represented as<br><code>:{emoji name}:</code> in the text.</p>
