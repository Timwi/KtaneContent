                        <h2>On the Subject of Forget Everything</h2>
                        <p class="flavour-text">I'm not sure what this is, and at this point I'm too afraid to ask.</p>
                        <ul>
                            <li>The dials, nixie tubes, and lights will update on each solved module*. The current stage is shown on the display, and stages are not in order.</li>
                            <li>When solving, put the stages in order based on the display, starting at 01.</li>
                            <li>For the first stage, take the dial values. This is your starting solution, and this stage is considered a valid stage.</li>
                            <li>For every stage there-after, determine if the stage is valid. If it is, refer to the next page for modifying your solution.</li>
                            <li>After all stages have been shown, the stage display will turn blank, and the nixie tubes and lights will shut off. This indicates the module is ready to be solved.</li>
                            <li>Enter your solution using the dials, and turn the key to solve the module.</li>
                            <li>Do not attempt to interact with the module before it is ready to be solved, and always wait for dials to stop before turning the key.</li>
                            <li>If your answer is incorrect, you will gain one free position check, indicated by the LED next to the stage display.</li>
							<li>Position checks can be entered using 0s with a single 1 to view all relevant stages (i.e. 0001000000 shows 4th, 14th, 24th...).</li>
							<li>Position checks can be done without a free check, but will incur a strike.</li>
                        </ul>
                        Follow these steps to determine if a stage is valid:
                        <ul>
                            <li>If the previous two stages were both valid, this stage is not valid.</li>
                            <li>If the previous two stages were both not valid, this stage is valid.</li>
                            <li>If neither of the above apply, or if there are not two previous stages, this stage is valid if both numbers shown in the nixie tubes are on the dials.</li>
                        </ul>
                        Follow these steps to determine the stage colour:
                        <ul>
                            <li>If three colours are shown, the stage colour is the one that is not shown.</li>
                            <li>Otherwise, the stage colour is the colour that appears multiple times.</li>
                        </ul>
                        Refer to the next page for modifying your solution using valid stages.

                            <li>Take the least significant digit of the stage number (treat 0 as 10), this is the dial position (left to right).</li>
                            <li>Look at the table below to determine what operation to use.</li>
                            <li>Perform the operation below using the current solution number as the "previous" number and the stage dial number as the "current" number.</li>
                            <li>Replace the solution number at the dial position with the answer from the operation.</li>
                            <li>Keep solution digits in the 0-9 range after each operation, by adding or subtracting 10.</li>
