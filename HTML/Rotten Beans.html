                    This module looks similar to <a class="beans-link" href='Beans.html'>Beans</a>, but with a few differences. Some of the beans are smelly beans (green). To solve the module, you
                    must consume three valid beans (but no more). However, hovering over a bean will highlight a different bean on the module. This is its 'referred' bean. When a bean is eaten, its
                    referred bean will be eaten instead. Once a bean is eaten, its referred bean is no longer shown. Once a bean has been eaten, the bean you ate now refers to the bean referred to by
                    the bean you ate. A bean cannot be pressed if it is smelly or refers to a smelly bean. You must eat the first valid bean in reading order. Attempting to eat an incorrect bean will
                    cause a strike. Eating more than three beans will also cause a strike but the module will stay solved. When a strike occurs, the module will no longer strike you.
                    <em><strong>Note that you cannot see a bean when it has been eaten.</strong></em>
