                    <p>This module looks similar to <a style='color: #222222;' href='Beans.html'>Beans</a>, but with a few differences. Some of the beans are smelly beans (green). To solve the module, you must consume three valid beans (but no more). However, hovering over a bean will highlight a different bean on the module. This is its 'referred' bean. When a bean is eaten, its referred bean will be eaten instead. Once a bean is eaten, its referred bean is no longer shown. Once a bean has been eaten, the bean you ate now refers to the bean referred to by the bean you ate. A bean cannot be pressed if it is smelly or refers to a smelly bean. Attempting to eat an incorrect bean will cause a strike. Eating more than three beans will also cause a strike but the module will stay solved. When a strike occurs, the module will no longer strike you. <em><strong>Note that you cannot see a bean when it has been eaten.</strong></em></p>
