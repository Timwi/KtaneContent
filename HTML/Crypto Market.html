                <h2>On the Subject of the Crypto Market</h2>
                <p class="flavour-text">This bomb thought it was a good idea to add a digital version of Wall Street on its case.</p>
                <ul>
                    <li>The module consists of 4 KTaNE Cryptos, displaying their current worth (Q4) to the right of each one.</li>
                    <li>The green number on the bottom represents the amount of KTaNE Currency (KC) you will be using.</li>
                    <li>Pressing one of the KTaNE Cryptos will display their quarterly growth/negative growth from top to bottom.</li>
                    <li>Pressing the view button will take you back to the Q4 values.</li>
                </ul>
                <h3 class="centered">Step 1: Peak/Slump Values</h3>
                <ul>
                    <li>Determine the value of each KTaNE Crypto in each quarter by applying each quarterly growth.</li>
                    <li>Remember that the current value each Crypto is worth is the Q4 value.</li>
                    <li>The 1<sup>st</sup> value is your starting value and each value afterwards is your quarterly values.</li>
                    <li>Rank each KTaNE Crypto by their PEAK VALUE. Assign 12 points to the Crypto with the highest PEAK VALUE and assign 3 fewer points to each subsequent Crypto.</li>
                    <li>Next, rank each KTaNE Crypto by their SLUMP VALUE. Assign 12 points to the Crypto with the highest SLUMP VALUE and assign 3 fewer points to each subsequent Crypto.</li>
                    <li>The peak and slump values are calculated exclusive of the starting prices.</li>
                </ul>
                <h3 class="centered">Step 2: Volatile Score</h3>
                <ul>
                    <li>Take each quarterly growth/negative growth and divide it by the Crypto Value previous to that quarter. Take the resulting value and multiply it by 100, removing any decimals.</li>
                    <li>Take the largest value and subtract it by the smallest value. This is the VOLATILE SCORE for that Crypto.</li>
                    <li>Rank each KTaNE Crypto by their VOLATILE SCORE. Assign 4 points to the Crypto with the highest VOLATILE SCORE and assign 4 more points to each subsequent Crypto.</li>
                    <li>If there is a tie between VOLATILE SCORES, take the average of points for those Cryptos and assign each of them that many points.</li>
                    <li>Ex: 1<sup>st</sup> and 2<sup>nd</sup> is a tie so they get (4 + 8) / 2 = 6 points. 2<sup>nd</sup>, 3<sup>rd</sup>, and 4<sup>th</sup> are tied so they get (8 + 12 + 16) / 3 = 12 points.</li>
                </ul>

                <h3 class="centered">Step 3: Investing</h3>
                <ul>
                    <li>Let X be a random number between 20 - 35.</li>
                    <li>Calculate the number of Cryptos you will invest for each one by using this equation: floor((X × Score) / 100)</li>
                    <li>If X is correct, then this equation should satisfy:<br>(A × AQ4) + (B × BQ4) + (C × CQ4) + (D × DQ4) = KC</li>
                    <li>Invest the amounts A,B,C,D for each KTaNE Crypto to disarm the module.</li>
                    <li>To invest, press the invest button. You should see the numbers on the right turn to yellow zeroes with a pair of arrows next to them.</li>
                    <li>Set each number to the amounts A,B,C,D for each KTaNE Crypto using the up/down arrows.</li>
                    <li>Press the invest button again to submit your answer.</li>
                </ul>
