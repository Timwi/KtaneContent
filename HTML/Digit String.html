                <h2>On the Subject of Digit String</h2>
                <p class="flavour-text">Terror has arrived in town, for some of your digits... are actually a sign!</p>
                <ul class="conditions-list">
                    <li>An eight-digit number is displayed in the bottom display screen. One or more of these digits must be replaced with a mathematical sign.</li>
                    <br />
                    <li>Starting with the first character in the bomb's serial number, if that character appears multiple times in the serial number, use the Repeat row in List B, otherwise use the row associated with that character.</li>
                    <br />
                    <li>If any number indicated by that condition is found in the displayed number, and replacing the number would NOT result in the sign being either before or after all of the remaining digits, that number should be replaced with a sign. If there are multiple such numbers in the string, use the first applicable instance. Use Table A to determine which sign to use. If a number was replaced, stop and evaluate what you have, otherwise, continue with the next serial number character.</li>
                    <br />
                    <li>If none of the characters' conditions caused a sign to replace a number, replace the Xth digit of the displayed number with a plus sign, where X is the number of different serial number characters plus one (A00AA0 would count as 2 different characters).</li>
                    <br />
                    <li>Once you have replaced the digit(s) with a sign, evaluate what you get, then type the answer in with the keypad.</li>
                    <br />
                    <li>Use the C button to clear the display and the Submit button to submit your answer. If the answer is correct, the module will be disarmed, otherwise, a strike will be given.</li>
