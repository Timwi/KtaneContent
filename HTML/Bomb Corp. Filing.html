                <p class="flavour-text">Uh.. I think this was a "holdable" or something? Just sort these module names and you won't blow up.</p>

                <p>Simply sort the module names in the order described at the top of the module. For example, if the instructions are "Sort module names from A to Z," you'd sort Abstract Sequences before Bamboozled Again, Bamboozled Again before Caesar Cipher, and so on.</p>
                <p>Sorting a module name incorrectly will cause a strike, but the next name you file will replace the one you just incorrectly filed. This way, you can continue on filing the correct names.</p>
                <h3>Sorting Rules:</h3>
                <p>(Reverse these for Z-A.)</p>
                <ul>
                    <li>Numbers come first. "14" would be sorted before "Alphabet Tiles." A-Z = 0-9</li>
                    <li>Modules that have special characters like percent signs will not be included in the holdable, for simplicity. (I'm looking at you, % Gray and ...?)</li>
                    <li>Nothing comes before something. "Dungeon," with nothing after it, would come before "Dungeon 2nd Floor."</li>
                    <li>And obviously, if two modules start with the same letter, sort by the second letter. If that's the same, sort by the third letter, and so on.</li>
                </ul>
                <p>By the way, the module names are pulled from the modules that YOU currently have installed. Don't have any modded modules installed? Don't worry! While the module prioritizes using modded module names for more variety, it will fall back to vanilla module names if it needs to.</p>
