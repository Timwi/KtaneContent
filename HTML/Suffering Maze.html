I can somehow visualize a low-dimensional object being able to somewhat adapt to an increase in one dimension, albeit with extreme rarity, but being able to tolerate this high of an increase in dimensions without instantly erasing its existence is just really, really hard to believe.</p>
                <p style="font-family: Fragile Bombers; color: #FFFFFF; font-size: 18px; font-style: italic; line-height: 18px;">"What kind of entity are you? You may believe that I am an entity beyond comprehension, but your existence is quite an impossible oddity."</p>
                <p style="font-family: Fragile Bombers; color: #FFFFFF; font-size: 18px; font-style: italic; line-height: 18px;">"Alright, time to accommodate your construct to handle the higher dimensions. It's time for us to talk once again."</p>

I know that I left a comment about meeting once again, but this has never been one of my observations, and I have made so many of them."</p>
                <p style="font-family: Altone; color: #FFFFFF; font-size: 15px; line-height: 18px;">I know you! You're the entity that gave me a device and things of some sort.</p>
                <p style="font-family: Fragile Bombers; color: #FFFFFF; font-size: 18px; font-style: italic; line-height: 18px;">"Yes, it is indeed me."</p>
                <p style="font-family: Altone; color: #FFFFFF; font-size: 15px; line-height: 18px;">"What happened? Your instruction said my dimensional alignment would be corrected when I got ejected."</p>
                <p style="font-family: Fragile Bombers; color: #FFFFFF; font-size: 18px; font-style: italic; line-height: 18px;">"That is indeed what was supposed to happen. There should be a 0% chance of failure with the construct I have provided."</p>
                <p style="font-family: Fragile Bombers; color: #FFFFFF; font-size: 18px; font-style: italic; line-height: 18px;">"For an unknown reason, you have been transported into a much higher dimension, high enough that your dimension misalignment would cause an instantaneous dimensional collision. The fact that you are functioning is an impossible oddity."</p>
                <p style="font-family: Altone; color: #FFFFFF; font-size: 15px; line-height: 18px;">"So, I <u>suffer</u>ed through the process of being ejected and having the worst kind of feeling of my life just for me to arrive here. I am quite appalled."</p>
                <p style="font-family: Fragile Bombers; color: #FFFFFF; font-size: 18px; font-style: italic; line-height: 18px;">"While you will indeed feel the effects of dimensional alignment when you are ejected, the sensation you should have felt will remain similar. The more likely case is that the sensation is because of an extreme-dimensional misalignment. The fact that you didn't instantly evaporate is an impossible oddity."</p>
                <p style="font-family: Altone; color: #FFFFFF; font-size: 15px; line-height: 18px;">"Right..."</p>
                <p style="font-family: Altone; color: #FFFFFF; font-size: 15px; line-height: 18px;">There is going to be so much rethinking I need to do with my life if I ever come back alive. I can't believe I got into some kind of whatever this place is by navigating a virtual dungeon.</p>
                <p style="font-family: Altone; color: #FFFFFF; font-size: 15px; line-height: 18px;">"Where am I right now?"</p>
                <p style="font-family: Fragile Bombers; color: #FFFFFF; font-size: 18px; font-style: italic; line-height: 18px;">"You are currently on a similar kind of object as the previous one you traversed. This one has higher dimensions and a quirky spatial nature."</p>
                <p style="font-family: Altone; color: #FFFFFF; font-size: 15px; line-height: 18px;">"So, do I have to do that again? I can't believe this."</p>
                <p style="font-family: Fragile Bombers; color: #FFFFFF; font-size: 18px; font-style: italic; line-height: 18px;">"I am quite uncertain about your concern. You were able to handle the previous one, and this object isn't that complex compared to the previous one."</p>
                <p style="font-family: Altone; color: #FFFFFF; font-size: 15px; line-height: 18px;">"Just give me the new instructions."</p>
                <p style="font-family: Fragile Bombers; color: #FFFFFF; font-size: 18px; font-style: italic; line-height: 18px;">"Alright. I will provide some updates to the previous instructions to accommodate the nature of this object."</p>
                <p style="font-family: Altone; color: #FFFFFF; font-size: 15px; line-height: 18px;">"Before I do this hell of a procedure again, can I ask some questions now?"</p>
                <p style="font-family: Fragile Bombers; color: #FFFFFF; font-size: 18px; font-style: italic; line-height: 18px;">"I did tell you about answering your questions previously. Alright, I shall give answers to your questions."</p>
                <p style="font-family: Altone; color: #FFFFFF; font-size: 15px; line-height: 18px;">"How can you understand me? Or, I guess the better question is, how can I understand you?"</p>
                <p style="font-family: Fragile Bombers; color: #FFFFFF; font-size: 18px; font-style: italic; line-height: 18px;">"I summarized the dimension from which you likely originated and gathered as much information as possible about your understanding of the one you call 'language'. After getting a lot of information, I constructed a device that analyzes the contextual information that I give you into something much more aligned with your language. The same occurs when you give your information."</p>
                <p style="font-family: Fragile Bombers; color: #FFFFFF; font-size: 18px; font-style: italic; line-height: 18px;">"We are also not necessarily having a conversation. It's more like I am reading the information coming directly, and I am using a device that can directly give you my information."</p>
                <p style="font-family: Altone; color: #FFFFFF; font-size: 15px; line-height: 18px;">"Honestly, that sounds like you are just reading my brain."</p>
                <p style="font-family: Fragile Bombers; color: #FFFFFF; font-size: 18px; font-style: italic; line-height: 18px;">"I can't necessarily deny that, but that is not the equivalence of what I am doing. I can't really give you a visualization of what the device does, but I can certainly say that I am not doing such a thing."</p>
                <p style="font-family: Altone; color: #FFFFFF; font-size: 15px; line-height: 18px;">"OK, I guess. So, what happened to me when I was ejected?"</p>
                <p style="font-family: Fragile Bombers; color: #FFFFFF; font-size: 18px; font-style: italic; line-height: 18px;">"Normally, the construct and you should have been dimensionally aligned, but since you did not return to your origin, I am unsure. I don't really experience things like you do since I have high dimensions, so I can't provide an answer to this question."</p>
                <p style="font-family: Altone; color: #FFFFFF; font-size: 15px; line-height: 18px;">"Fair enough, I suppose. What are these objects that I am inside of?"</p>
                <p style="font-family: Fragile Bombers; color: #FFFFFF; font-size: 18px; font-style: italic; line-height: 18px;">"These are what you would call 'puzzles'. The two objects you went to are instances of generative mazes. These are just a few objects that are around. There are many more that aren't just mazes. There are some that are very complex. All of them are handmade creations that I made."</p>
                <p style="font-family: Altone; color: #FFFFFF; font-size: 15px; line-height: 18px;">"Hmm... I guess I ran out of questions to give. You can give me the instructions now, I suppose."</p>
                <p style="font-family: Fragile Bombers; color: #FFFFFF; font-size: 18px; font-style: italic; line-height: 18px;">"Understood. Before you proceed, can I ask you a question?"</p>
                <p style="font-family: Altone; color: #FFFFFF; font-size: 15px; line-height: 18px;">"Ask me? I am not really sure I can provide you with a satisfactory answer, but go ahead."</p>
                <p style="font-family: Fragile Bombers; color: #FFFFFF; font-size: 18px; font-style: italic; line-height: 18px;">"How did you arrive at the previous object? What happened that caused you to get access to a higher dimension?"</p>
                <p style="font-family: Altone; color: #FFFFFF; font-size: 15px; line-height: 18px;">"Oh... I guess I can give you an answer to that one. I was desperate for money due to my circumstances, so I accepted an offer that had me navigating virtual dungeons. The dungeons were not strange in the slightest, and they have different aspects like puzzles and the like, so I thought it was just a very good deal for me."</p>
                <p style="font-family: Altone; color: #FFFFFF; font-size: 15px; line-height: 18px;">"One day, after finishing my last dungeon, everything around me just collapsed. It's like something shattering, but it's my entire field of view. I remember traversing through nothing until I passed out, I think."</p>
                <p style="font-family: Fragile Bombers; color: #FFFFFF; font-size: 18px; font-style: italic; line-height: 18px;">"Interesting. This is beyond what I expected. I thought it would involve something about spatial manipulation, but this answer is just way off. I guess I need to make observations about this phenomenon next."</p>
                <p style="font-family: Fragile Bombers; color: #FFFFFF; font-size: 18px; font-style: italic; line-height: 18px;">"You have provided me with a satisfactory answer. Now, I shall provide you with updated instructions for this object. While I could ask you and I could ask for more information, I think it's best for you to move along. I am not sure how long you can last being dimensionally misaligned."</p>
                <p style="font-family: Fragile Bombers; color: #FFFFFF; font-size: 18px; font-style: italic; line-height: 18px;">"If we ever somehow meet again, we'll get to answer any more questions you may have. Maybe I could even ask some questions too."</p>
                <p style="font-family: Altone; color: #FFFFFF; font-size: 15px; line-height: 18px;">...</p>
                <p style="font-family: Altone; color: #FFFFFF; font-size: 15px; line-height: 18px;">I guess it's up to me once again to get out of this, whatever this place is. I am just thankful that I am lucky to stumble into an entity that is able to help. I hope I can get out in one piece.</p>
                <p style="font-size: 0px;">The entity has not asked the question of direct guidance, but I guess the answer of me being near causing a dimensional collision is interpreted that way. It is a convenient way for me to keep observing. Also, I need to gather information about this new phenomenon. I have never seen this happen before. This will make a good utility for a potential device I could make if I can understand the cause of it. I never thought a single entity could cause such phenomena to occur, but I guess there is a first time for everything. I hope we can meet once again so I can keep observing, but I do think you need to continue with your normal existence. But still, it has been a good experience while it lasted.</p>

                <p style="color:#FFFFFF; font-family: Fragile Bombers;">Project Red has the following characteristics:</p>
                <ul style="color:#FFFFFF; font-family: Fragile Bombers;">
                    <li>Object Classification: Hepteractic Maze</li>
                    <li>Universal Coordinate Layout: (t,u,v,w,z,x,y)
                        <ul>

                            <li>5th Dimension (Probability): v</li>
                            <li>4th Dimension (Timeline): w</li>

                            <li>The object can generate a maze layout that has pathways that lead nowhere. If a movement in that direction happens, the construct will move to the opposite side in the same dimension instead of going out of bounds. The <u>Coordinate Equivalence</u> will be adjusted to reflect this change.</li>
                        </ul>

                <p style="color:#FFFFFF; font-family: Fragile Bombers;">With the given instrument that is provided, the initial layout will show different interactable directional arrows. The purpose of the arrows is to travel a single unit in a given dimension. The arrow directions have been provided in a two-dimensional manner to make use of the more intuitive nature of your knowledge of directions. These are the following movements that will be performed for each associated arrow:</p>
                <table style="color:#FFFFFF; font-family: Fragile Bombers;">

                </table>
                <p style="color:#FFFFFF; font-family: Fragile Bombers;">When an arrow is pressed, the construct will move towards that direction by one unit. If a barrier is interacted when the movement occurs, the construct's movement will be halted and a dimensional ripple will occur. <u>It may lead to unintended effects outside your location.</u></p>

                <p style="color:#FFFFFF; font-family: Fragile Bombers;">On each coordinate on the grid, there will be a certain symbol that will be shown. These symbols will be used in <u>Maze Generation: Origin Shift</u> when creating the maze layout of the object.</p>
                <p style="color:#FFFFFF; font-family: Fragile Bombers;">Due to certain aspects of how the object was built, it is not possible to map the object in a consistent form. As such, the assignments for the map coordinates will be based on a given internal seed. This seed is a 30-character string that is shown during <u>The Multidemensional Directional Movement.</u> The seed also uses character symbols you are much more accustomed to.</p>
                <p style="color:#FFFFFF; font-family: Fragile Bombers;">Each symbol shown on the grids will have a corresponding character on the given seed. Based on the character's position on the seed in reading order, these are the following functionalities of each character placement:</p>

                    <li>To start, create a grid of 2x2x2x2x2x2x2 cells. Each cell will contain a barrier in each direction.</li>
                    <li>For each cell coordinate, perform the following:
                        <ul>
                            <li>Remove the corresponding barrier of this cell (the origin) and its adjacent cell so that the two cells can have a pathway between each other. The adjacent cell is based on the origin cell's <u>Direction Equivalence.</u> The adjacency is affected by the object's quirk.</li>
