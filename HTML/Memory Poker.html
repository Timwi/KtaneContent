                <h2>On the Subject of Memory Poker</h2>
                <p class="flavour-text">“If a group you belonged to needed a scapegoat, who would you choose? If it was me, I would choose neither friend nor foe, but the person whose sacrifice would make no one angry or sad.”</p>
                <p>The module will initially display a 4×4 grid of cards. Some of the cards will be face down, while others will be face up. The cards are arranged within the grid so that:</p>
                <ul>
                    <li>Every card will be a Jack, Queen, King, or Ace.</li>
                    <li>Every card will be a Club, Heart, Spade, or Diamond.</li>
                    <li>No two cards will be exactly the same.</li>
                    <li>Every row, column, and main diagonal will have exactly one card of each suit and rank.</li>
                </ul>

                <p>Determine the suit and rank of all 16 cards. This is the module’s <strong>starting configuration</strong>. When you are ready to begin playing, select any card. Upon doing so, all face up cards will flip face down, and three cards will flip face up.</p>
                <p>Each of the face up cards will represent a “table card”. For each face up card, use its current position, combined with the location of the matching card in the starting configuration (its “initial position”) to get a rank and a suit using the conditions on page 2.</p>
                <p>Using these table cards, and the 16 cards from the starting configuration, determine the best possible 5-card poker hand using two different cards from the starting configuration.</p>
                <p>If there is a tie, any valid answer will be accepted. Submit your answer by selecting the positions of those two cards in the module’s starting configuration. If the two cards selected do not form the optimal poker hand, the module will reset back to its initial state. Submit 3 correct answers to solve the module.</p>
                <br>
                <p>Note that all ranks are abbreviated by their first letter (including ten).<br>
                    Also note that you cannot choose cards which have already flipped over.</p>
