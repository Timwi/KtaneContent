                <h2>On the Subject of Footnotes</h2>
                <p class="flavour-text">This module will be a piece of cake*.</p>
                <p>Follow the instructions* on the module. If the instructions are followed correctly, the module will be disarmed. Otherwise, you will get a strike.</p>
                <h3>* Footnotes</h3>
                <p>The instructions on the module are incorrect, and should be altered. Find the bulleted group of lists for the footnote symbol used on the module, and adjust the footnoted element of the instructions by one, using the footnote symbol’s list in which the footnoted element appears. If the sum of the serial number’s digits is greater than the latest position in the English language of the serial number’s letters, advance one element forward, otherwise, advance one element backwards. If you go past one end of the proper list, wrap around to the other end of the same list.</p>
