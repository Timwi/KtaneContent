                <p><i>Use Appendix BLANK in <a href="Blind Alley.html">Blind Alley</a> for blank module identification</i></p>
                <p>
                    This module will initially appear blank, but it actually should display a part of html code if you click it.
                    Maybe multiple times? Hopefully that should work. It will ding to indicate this. When it displays this html code, use the... template manual? What? WhEre am I??
                    I guess find the html code on this manual and click it? The number says which one of the same html code should be clicked, so p1
                    would mean find the first paragraph code in the template manual and ul1li2 would mean find the first bullet point list and second bullet point.
                    Table and div html is not included, and nested things are not the same as what they are nested in (ul,li,ul,li is not the same as 2 ul,li’s).
                    Click the link on that piece of html and it should send you to a different manual page, and then extract a value from that page using the table below, and submit it in.
                    The number of times you clicked it before html text was shown and the colour of the display (shown when inputting) are used as modifiers.
                </p>
                <p>
                    When you don’t need to see the html anymore, just click on it again to reveal a keypad and display to show the input.
                    To reset the input, type in more than 9 digits (exception to this is simon statement where you can’t reset input). When finished making the input,
                    click the display and the module will go back to its original state, dinging again if the submission
                    was correct or striking and completely resetting if wrong. If correct, go through another stage to complete the module.
                </p>

                            The amount of dimensions start at 3 and every 3 clicks increases it by 2 (this is recalculated if this module is chosen again). Assume all rotations make a subrotation that goes through every positive dimension (eg. 4 dimensions would have the
                            subrotation X+Y+Z+W and it has already been flipped so that rule need not apply), unless the display colour modifies rotations, then set that rotation to a negative.

                            For example if the display switches the second dimension of X+Y+Z+W, the subrotation is now X-Y+Z+W.
                            Blue display changes 1st and 3rd, if applicable, red display changes 7th and 9th, if applicable, yellow changes
                            5th and 6th, and if applicable, green display changes 4th and 7th.
                            Once the rotations have been found, take the output from the primary values table and if it is negative, add 2 to the power of dimensions to it
                            (3 dimensions add 8, 5 dimensions add 32, 7 dimensions add 128, 9 dimensions add 512), make it binary, then make the 1st digit a 1 
                            (so 0000101 would become 1000101), then find the gray code (ignoring the a.x change step) before submitting it.

                                If the colour is blue, the section used is ‘Nothing Initially Happens’. In this case, split the number
                                of clicks into 4, taking each one modulo 10, one being clicks + portplates, clicks + batteries, clicks + solvedmodules (calculated when

                                being the 2nd digit of the serial number modulo 5 + 1. Add the colour value with 7x the clicks. The values of the colours are
                                red as 16, grey as 5, white as 1, orange as 9, green as 12, yellow as 20, purple as 32 and blue as 64.

                                The middle row number obtained % 8 + 1 is the real column to use (if there is not a middle use the topmost row), and using that column instead,
                                input the col-port number, then col-battery number, then col-litind number.

                                and take the first word from left to right that has one of their letters appear in the serial number (if none take the last). Turn the letters into their respective
                                tap code and submit (eg. ZBZ = 551255 as A=11, B=12 and Z=55).

                            Modulo the clicks amount by 7 and look it up in the movement table on indicators. Take the color of the display
                            and look it up in the table too on the right and left LEDs (if yellow, use orange). Follow the instructions on moving around the grid, with
                            both the ‘Finding the TX number’ and ‘Turning the word into a number’ grids, to get two separate numbers (if the first one
                            is a 0, make it 200). The ‘Turning the word into a number’ number should be modified as said in the manual BUT skip all the
                            letter modification rules and turning the number into a letter. Divide number 1 with number 2, eg. 200/20 = 10, modulo the value
                            by 64, remove all decimals, convert it into binary and submit (so 10 would become 1010).

                            Determine the stage number as said in the manual, except the duplicate port type rule can only apply once.
                            The stage variable is equal to the amount of times the display color changed + 1. Also, the serial rule is interpreted
                            by this manual as if a letter from the serial number is in a lit indicator, add 2 and move on to the next serial number letter.
                            After these rules, if it is negative, do the adding rule. If now it is single digit swap the digits, so 03 becomes 30,
                            or if 0 make it 10, and if now it is greater than 49 do the subtracting rule.
                            Use the color of the display and the next color that the display could be as the 2 colors flashing (the order of display
                            colors are blue,red,yellow and green, and loop around), then follow the manual as normal replacing the statement with going down the operator table
                            by the amount of clicks % 8 + 1 (so 3 clicks would mean operator 4, meaning NAND).

                            Use these colours to do step 2. Input the number from step 1 but do not submit, and the display may change color.
                            If this new color is the colour retrieved from the tables, then submit.
                            Else, use this new color for the statement and repeat all the steps again, change the number again, and input the number again
                            (when this number is inputted, it should go along with the previous number, so inputting 11 when last time was 70 would make 7011),
                            check the display color etc. When 8 digits have been typed, the module will not change the display color and you can submit.
                            If the display is the right color but more digits are inputted, the module will strike. If the wrong digits are inputted, the module
                            will only strike when the rest of the input is typed in. If more than 8 digits are inputted the module will strike.

                            The first letter of the display is the first letter of the serial number, and the other 2 letters are the first 2 letters
                            of the color of the display (red - RE, blue - BL, yellow - YE, green - GR). Go through the manual as normal BUT skip the action
                            priority list and instead use the arrow with the highest amount of statements (ties dont matter as there is still a highest amount
                            of statements number). Type in the amount of correct statements it had, then all of the other arrows’ amount of correct statements
                            from lowest to highest (eg. if UP arrow was the right arrow to press, if it had 5 true statements, and the other three had 2, 4 and 1,
                            the number to submit would be 5124).
