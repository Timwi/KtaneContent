                <h2>On the Subject of The Burnt</h2>
                <p class="flavour-text">The ritual must continue.</p>

                <p>This module will present ritual flames, representing each of those performing it.<br />A red flame is one person, a green flame ten, and a blue flame one hundred.<br />The more power there is in the ritual, the easier the module will be to solve. Fanning the flames once will make them stable. Fanning again may solve the module.</p>
                
                <h1>Power</h1>
                <p>For every green flame, you will have to perform the steps below one fewer time.<br />Also, if the bomb’s voltage is greater than the number of red flames, you will have to perform the steps two fewer times.<br />If there is no voltage indicator, the bomb has zero volts.<br />You will always have to perform at least one step.</p>
                
                <h1>Steps</h1>
                <p>Start with a value of one.<br />Repeat these steps ten times, minus any conditions under Power:</p>
                <ul><li>Multiply your current value by the number of red flames minus the number of blue flames.</li>
                <li>After each multiplication, take the digital root of the result. This is your new value.</li></ul>
                <p>Finally, once you have completed all of the previous steps, fan the flames for the second time when the last seconds digit of the bomb’s timer reads that value.</p>
