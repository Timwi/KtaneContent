                <h2>On the Subject of Identifrac</h2>
                <p class="flavour-text">Psychedelic structural chaos</p>
                <p>The module displays a cubic fractal and two overlapping diamonds, segmented into 7 smaller diamonds. In order to solve the module, reduce the fractal to its seed and submit that.</p>
                <p>The fractal originates from a 2×2×2 grid. This grid is called the seed. To obtain the next iteration of a grid, the grid from the previous iteration is copied onto each individual cell of the seed, applying the transformation given by that respective cell in the seed. Ignore empty cells. Once this process has been repeated an infinite amount of times, a true fractal has been obtained.</p>
                <p>Each active cubic cell in the seed has a value. This value consists of 5 separate values:</p>
                <ol>
                    <li>If the X-axis must be inverted: 1. Otherwise: 0</li>
                    <li>If the Y-axis must be inverted: 1. Otherwise: 0</li>
                    <li>If the Z-axis must be inverted: 1. Otherwise: 0</li>
                    <li>If the X-axis and Y-axis must be swapped: 1. Otherwise: 0</li>
                    <li>If the X, Y, and Z-axis must be cycled 1 step forward: 1. If it must be cycled 2 steps forward: 2. Otherwise: 0</li>
                </ol>
                <p>The transforms should be applied in order.</p>
                <p>This value will be 5 digits. To convert these to answers, use your value ABCDE and turn it into 24A+12B+6C+3D+E. Divide this value by 7 and round down for the first digit and modulo this value by 7 for the second. Use this digit pair as the answer for that cell of the seed. Empty cells are labeled with digit pair 66. Cells are read from left to right, then bottom to top, then front to back, as shown in the first diagram. The axes on this module are shown in the second diagram. Note that Y is actually facing outwards from the bomb. The buttons are numbered from 0 to 6 according to the third diagram below. After submitting all 16 digits, your answer will be checked. All diagrams are based on viewing the module straight on.</p>
