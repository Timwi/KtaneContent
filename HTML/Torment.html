                <h2>On the Subject of Torment</h2>
                <p class="flavour-text">I will never forgive you for what you did.</p>

                <p>The module consists of a 4 × 4 chessboard with numbers on each of the tiles. The white tiles normally seen on a chess board have been replaced with red.</p>
                <p>There is also a button at the top of the module that displays a four-letter word.</p>
                <p>The function of the module will change based on its <b><u>phase</u></b>. The module will cycle between the 3 <b><u>phases</u></b> by pressing on the top button.</p>
                <ul>
                    <li><b>LOOK: </b>During this phase, the chessboard will show an arrangement of numbers on each tile that ranges from 0-2. You can not interact with any of the chessboard tiles during this phase.</li>
                    <li>
                        <b>FALL: </b>During this phase, the numbers on the chessboard will disappear. Pressing a tile on the board will show 7-9 numbers at different coordinates.
                        The numbers that are shown on each tile can be either 1 or 2. Each of those coordinates will change color to white when this happens.
                        During the <b><u>STOP</u></b> phase, the numbers that will be added at each given coordinate are based on what numbers were shown when pressing a certain tile.
                    </li>
                    <li>
                        <b>STOP: </b>During this phase, the chessboard will display the same number from 0 to 2 on each of the tiles.
                        Based on the conditions shown during the <b><u>FALL</u></b> phase, press 3 <u>unique tile coordinates</u> on the chessboard so that after the 3 presses,
                        the resulting number arrangement on the chessboard will be equal to what was shown during the <b><u>LOOK</u></b> phase.
                        During each tile press, if a coordinate ever goes past 2 when a number is added to it, the number will be modulo by 3.
                        The tile coordinate you have pressed will become uninteractable as well. After pressing 3 unique tiles, the chessboard will be uninteractable.
                        If the module is not solved at any point during this phase, you can leave by pressing the top button.
                        This will send you back to the <b><u>LOOK</u></b> phase where everything will be completely reset.
                    </li>
                </ul>
                <p>When the <b><u>LOOK</u></b> phase begins, there is a 10 second timer that will countdown. When you reach the <b><u>STOP</u></b> phase, the built-in timer must reach 0 before you can cycle back to the <b><u>LOOK</u></b> phase.</p>
