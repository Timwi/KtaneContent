                <p>
                    This module looks similar to <a style='color: #222222;' href='Beans.html'>Beans</a>, but with a few differences.
                    There are five pods initially, but peeling a pod or hovering over a pod will reveal its beans.
                    A pod can have up to two beans, however some of a pod’s beans may be missing. To solve the module, you must eat three beans (but no more).
                    If no valid beans are present, the module will not strike you for eating a different one.
                    Attempting to eat an invalid bean will cause a strike. Eating more than three beans will also cause a strike but the module will stay solved.
                    <em><strong>Note that you cannot see a bean when it has been eaten.</strong></em>
                </p>

                <h3>Finding Valid Beans</h3>

                <p>
                    The module will always have one valid bean. To find this bean, take the beanary representation of the current state of the beans (0 = not present, 1 = present),
                    convert it to decimal and subtract 10 until it is within 0 and 9. This value is the position of the valid bean [indexed at 0].
                    Luckily, the beans are more hygienic and have taken precautionary measures (bean sanitizer, bean shells, etc) so this means that adjacent beans can still be eaten.
                    <em><strong>Note that eating a bean will change the beanary, causing a change in the valid bean.</strong></em>
