                    <p>This module looks similar to <a style='color: #222222;' href='Beans.html'>Beans</a>, but with a few differences. There are five pods initially, but peeling a pod or hovering over a pod will reveal its beans. A pod can have up to two beans, however some of a pod's beans may be missing. To solve the module, you must eat three beans (but no more). If no valid beans are present, the module will not strike you for eating a different one. Attempting to eat an invalid bean will cause a strike. Eating more than three beans will also cause a strike but the module will stay solved. <em><strong>Note that you cannot see a bean when it has been eaten.</strong></em></p>

                    <h3>Finding Valid Beans</h3>
                    
                    <p>The module will always have one valid bean. To find this bean, take the beanary representation of the current state of the beans (0 = not present, 1 = present), convert it to decimal and subtract 10 until it is within 0 and 9. This value is the position of the valid bean [indexed at 0]. Luckily, the beans are more hygenic and have taken precautionary measures (bean sanitizer, bean shells, etc) so this means that adjacent beans can still be eaten. <em><strong>Note that eating a bean will change the beanary, causing a change in the valid bean.</strong></em></p>
