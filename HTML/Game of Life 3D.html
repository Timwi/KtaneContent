                <h2>On the Subject of Game of Life 3D</h2>
                <p class="flavour-text">Life-and-death scenarios aren’t limited to the second dimension, y’know.</p>
                <p>
                    A 3×3×3 arrangement of black and white cells will be floating in front of the module. Apply the rules of Conway’s Game of Life to the arrangement of cells once, then enter this
                    generation into the module. When pressed, the arrows surrounding the cells will rotate the formation 90 degrees in their respective directions. You may do this to get a better view
                    of the arrangement of cells.
                </p>
                <p>
                    Click a cell to toggle its state. The button labelled RESET will return the module to its initial state; the button labelled CLEAR will make all of the cells black. Both of these
                    buttons will reset the rotation of the arrangement of cells.
                </p>
                <p>
                    Cells are considered adjacent if they share an edge — this means that the cells at the corners have six neighbours, and that all others have eight. There is no cell in the centre of
                    the arrangement.
                </p>

                <ul>
                    <li>Alive cells will stay alive if they have two or three alive neighbours, otherwise they will die.</li>
                    <li>Dead cells will be born if they have exactly three alive neighbours, otherwise they will stay dead.</li>
                    <li>White cells are considered alive. Black cells are considered dead.</li>
