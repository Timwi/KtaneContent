                <h2>On the Subject of Remember Me Now</h2>
                <p class="flavour-text">Aren’t you supposed to be remembering something?</p>

                <p>This module consists of two LEDs, a primary and secondary display, a ten button keypad, an “Accept” button, and a “Reject” button.</p>

                <p>To solve this module, the defuser must submit the correct numbers in stage 2 using numbers from stage 1.</p>

                <h3>Stage 1:</h3>

                <p>During this stage, the expert must determine if the currently displayed number is valid or invalid depending on the colours of the two LEDs.</p>

                <p>Using the table on the second page, if the statement corresponding to the LED’s colour is true, the current number is valid, otherwise it is invalid. Once a number’s validity is determined, the defuser must <b>“Accept”</b> <u>valid</u> numbers and <b>“Reject”</b> <u>invalid</u> numbers. Make sure to note down which numbers have been accepted or rejected as these are used in stage 2.</p>

                <p>A timer is present during this stage and is shown on the secondary display to the right of the primary display. The timer starts at 40 seconds per instance of Remember Me Now present on the bomb, and will reset when receiving a new number. If the timer runs out, it will incur a strike and will cause the module to reset completely, forgetting all previously accepted and rejected numbers.</p>

                <ul>
                    <li><b><u>IMPORTANT:</u></b> If both LEDs are on, it’s considered a “Compound Statement”. When dealing with compound statements, the current number is valid if <b><u>ONLY ONE</u></b> statement is true. Otherwise it is invalid.</li>
                </ul>

                <p>Once enough numbers have been accepted or rejected, the primary display will become blank, the secondary display will show the amount of accepted numbers, and stage 2 will begin.</p>

                <h3>Stage 2:</h3>
                <p>During this stage the defuser must submit the valid numbers accepted in stage 1, using the “Accept” button, in the order they were accepted, adding leading zeros for non-four digit numbers. Each successfully submitted number will take one off of the secondary display’s counter.</p>

                <ul>
                    <li><b><u>IMPORTANT:</u></b> If any numbers were rejected in stage 1, they will affect the number required to submit. The formula to find the correct number is: <br><b>|</b>The current accepted number <b>-</b> The current rejected number<b>|</b>.</li>
                    <li><b><u>EXAMPLE:</u></b> If the first accepted number was 1234, and the first rejected number was 4321, the difference would be -3087, the absolute value of which is 3087.</li>
