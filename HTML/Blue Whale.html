                    <p class="flavour-text"><b>*KLAXON*</b> “BLUE WHALE”</p>
                    <p>This module will present you with an image of a blue whale, and four buttons containing statements about the blue whale.</p>
                    <p>To solve the module, simply select the statement that is true.</p>
                    <p>Be careful, as almost every wrong answer is either very similar to the facts, or common misconceptions about the blue whale.</p>
                    <p>The following is a list of statements about blue whales that have been proven to be true.</p>
                    <ul>
                        <li>Blue whales are the largest animals on earth</li>
                        <li>They are incapable of eating anything larger than a grapefruit</li>
                        <li>These whales are able to hear from up to 1,600 kilometers away</li>
                        <li>They can also weigh up to 200 tons</li>
                        <li>On the IUCN Red List, they are considered an endangered species</li>
                        <li>A blue whale’s tongue is about as heavy as one adult elephant</li>
                        <li>Their heart is the largest of any species on earth</li>
                        <li>Despite their size, they are still sometimes attacked by orca whales</li>
                    </ul>
                    <p>Whale is judging you. Do not let him down.</p>
