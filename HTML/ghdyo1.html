                <h2>On the Subject of ghdyo1</h2>
                <p class="flavour-text">Just for clarification, we do not call him that. For us, his name is simple - Jevil. Like the character from Deltarune.</p>

                <p>The module contains some coordinates, 4 directional arrows, and the forward button.</p>
                <p>Let's keep it simple: you're playing as Jevil, and you're trying to escape from your parents that are trying to get you to go to <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dacha">dacha</a>.</p>
                <p>You spawn at the door: (2,2,2). To open it, you'll need three keys: (1,1,3), (1,3,1), (3,1,1). Your parents spawn at (0,0,0) and (4,4,4), their coordinates are always shown.</p>
                <p>If you collide with any key, you will pick it up. If you collide with the door and you have all the keys, the module will solve. If you collide with any parent, you will be teleported to (2,2,2), parents will be teleported to (0,0,0) and (4,4,4), but you'll keep the keys. This module never strikes.</p>
                <p>You can rotate using the directional arrows. If there is no wall in front of you, then pressing the forward button will move you one cell forward. If a digit is red, then it's gonna decrement upon moving, else increment in case of the digit being green. Parents will move 1 cell in some direction every 2 successful moves of yours. <b>Collision is simultaneous presence of 2 objects in same cell.</b></p>
