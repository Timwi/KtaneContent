                <ul>
                    <li>The module consists of four companies cycling their quarterly growth/negative growth, a company selection array and an invest button.</li>
                    <li>To disarm the module, invest in the most profitable company according to the criteria below.</li>
                    <li>Investing in the wrong company will reset the companies and figures and cause a strike.</li>
                </ul>
                <ul>
                    <li>Use the tables below to determine the names of the company from the abbreviations and their starting value from their colour.</li>
                    <li>The displays cycle the growth or negative growth of the four companies in each of the last year's quarters. Quarter 1 is preceeded by a short pause.</li>
                    <li>Use the growth and negative growth to calculate the company value at each of the four quarters.</li>
                </ul>
                <ul>
                    <li>Rank each company in order by their "peak value". Assign 30 points to the company with the highest "peak value" and assign 3 fewer points to each subsequent company.</li>
                    <li>Next, rank each company in order by their "slump value". Deduct 15 points from the company with the lowest "slump value" and deduct 2 fewer points from each subsequent company.</li>
                    <li>The peak and slump values are calculated exclusive of the starting prices.</li>
                </ul>
                <ul>
                    <li>Finally, assign points according to the fluctuations in each quarter.</li>
                    <li>Add two points for every fluctuation of +5 in each quarter up to a fluctuation of +25. Add four points for every fluctuation of +5 over +25 in each quarter.</li>
                    <li>Subtract two points for every fluctuation of -5 in each quarter down to a fluctuation of -25. Subtract four points for every fluctuation of -5 below -25 in each quarter.</li>
                </ul>
                <ul>
                    <li>Invest in the company with the highest number of points.</li>
