                <p class="writing">
                    Two households, both alike in dignity, In fair Verona, where we lay our scene, From ancient grudge break to new mutiny, Where civil blood makes civil hands unclean. From forth the fatal loins of these two foes A pair of star-cross’d lovers take their life; Whose misadventured piteous overthrows Do with their death bury their parents’ strife. The fearful passage of their death-mark’d love, And the continuance of their parents’ rage, Which, but their children’s end, nought could remove, Is now the two hours’ traffic of our stage; The which if you with patient ears attend, What here shall 
                    <span class="highlight">miss,</span> our toil shall strive to mend. Gregory, o’ my word, we’ll not carry coals. No, for then we should be colliers. I mean, an we be in choler, we’ll draw. Ay, while you live, draw your neck out o’ the collar. I strike quickly, being moved. But thou art not quickly moved to strike. A dog of the house of Montague moves me. To move is to stir; and to be valiant is to stand: therefore, if thou art moved, thou runn’st away. A dog of that house shall move me to stand: I will take the wall of 
                    <span class="highlight">any</span> man or maid of Montague’s. That shows thee a weak slave; for the weakest goes to the wall. True; and therefore women, being the weaker vessels, are ever thrust to the wall: therefore I will push Montague’s men from the wall, and thrust his maids to the wall. The quarrel is between our masters and us their men. ’Tis all one, I will show myself a tyrant: when I have fought with the men, I will be cruel with the maids, and cut off their heads. The heads of the maids? Ay, the heads of the maids, or their 
                    <span class="highlight">maidenheads;</span> take it in what sense thou wilt. They must take it in sense that feel it. Me they shall feel while I am able to stand: and ’tis known I am a pretty piece of flesh. ’Tis well thou art not fish; if thou hadst, thou hadst been poor John. Draw thy tool! here comes two of the house of the Montagues. My naked weapon is out: quarrel, I will back thee. How! turn thy back and run? Fear me not. No, marry; I fear thee! Let us take the law of our sides; let them begin. I will 
                    <span class="highlight">frown</span> as I pass by, and let them take it as they list. Nay, as they dare. I will bite my thumb at them; which is a disgrace to them, if they bear it. Do you bite your thumb at us, sir? I do bite my thumb, sir. Do you bite your thumb at us, sir? Is the law of our side, if I say ay? No. No, sir, I do not bite my thumb at you, sir, but I bite my thumb, sir. Do you quarrel, sir? Quarrel sir! no, sir. If you do, sir, I am for you:
                    <span class="highlight">I</span> serve as good a man as you. No better. Well, sir. Say ’better:’ here comes one of my master’s kinsmen. Yes, better, sir. You lie. Draw, if you be men. Gregory, remember thy swashing blow. Part, fools! Put up your swords; you know not what you do. What, art thou drawn among these heartless hinds? Turn thee, Benvolio, look upon thy death. I do but keep the peace: put up thy sword, Or manage it to part these men with me. What, drawn, and talk of peace! I hate the word, As I hate hell, all Montagues, and thee: 
                    <span class="highlight">Have</span> at thee, coward! Clubs, bills, and partisans! strike! beat them down! Down with the Capulets! down with the Montagues! What noise is this? Give me my long sword, ho! A crutch, a crutch! why call you for a sword? My sword, I say! Old Montague is come, And flourishes his blade in spite of me. Thou villain Capulet, Hold me not, let me go. Thou shalt not stir a foot to seek a foe. Rebellious subjects, enemies to peace, Profaners of this neighbour-stained steel, Will they not hear? What, ho! you men, you beasts, That quench the fire of 
                    <span class="highlight">your</span> pernicious rage With purple fountains issuing from your veins, On pain of torture, from those bloody hands Throw your mistemper’d weapons to the ground, And hear the sentence of your moved prince. Three civil brawls, bred of an airy word, By thee, old Capulet, and Montague, Have thrice disturb’d the quiet of our streets, And made Verona’s ancient citizens Cast by their grave beseeming ornaments, To wield old partisans, in hands as old, Canker’d with peace, to part your canker’d hate: If ever you disturb our streets again, Your lives shall pay the forfeit of the peace. For this 
                    <span class="highlight">time,</span> all the rest depart away: You Capulet; shall go along with me: And, Montague, come you this afternoon, To know our further pleasure in this case, To old Free-town, our common judgment-place. Once more, on pain of death, all men depart. Who set this ancient quarrel new abroach? Speak, nephew, were you by when it began? Here were the servants of your adversary, And yours, close fighting ere I did approach: I drew to part them: in the instant came The fiery Tybalt, with his sword prepared, Which, as he breathed defiance to my ears, He swung about his 
                    <span class="highlight">head</span>
                    and cut the winds, Who nothing hurt withal hiss’d him in scorn: While we were interchanging thrusts and blows, Came more and more and fought on part and part, Till the prince came, who parted either part. O, where is Romeo? saw you him to-day? Right glad I am he was not at this fray. Madam, an hour before the worshipp’d sun Peer’d forth the golden window of the east, A troubled mind drave me to walk abroad; Where, underneath the grove of sycamore That westward rooteth from the city’s side, So early walking did I see your son: <span class="highlight">Towards...</span>

                <p class="writing">
                    According to all known laws of aviation, there is no way a bee should be able to fly. Its wings are too small to get its fat little body off the ground. The bee, of course, flies anyway because bees don’t care what humans think is impossible. Yellow, black. Yellow, black. Yellow, black. Yellow, black. Ooh, black and yellow! Let’s shake it up a little. Barry! Breakfast is ready! Coming! Hang on a second. Hello? Barry? Adam? Can you believe this is happening? I can’t. I’ll pick you up. Looking sharp. Use the stairs. Your father paid good money 
                    <span class="highlight">for</span> those. Sorry. I’m excited. Here’s the graduate. We’re very proud of you, son. A perfect report card, all B’s. Very proud. Ma! I got a thing going here. You got lint on your fuzz. Ow! That’s me! Wave to us! We’ll be in row 118,000. Bye! Barry, I told you, stop flying in the house! Hey, Adam. Hey, Barry. Is that fuzz gel? A little. Special day, graduation. Never thought I’d make it. Three days grade school, three days high school. Those were awkward. Three days college. I’m glad I took a day and hitchhiked around the hive. 
                    <span class="highlight">You</span> did come back different. Hi, Barry. Artie, growing a mustache? Looks good. Hear about Frankie? Yeah. You going to the funeral? No, I’m not going. Everybody knows, sting someone, you die. Don’t waste it on a squirrel. Such a hothead. I guess he could have just gotten out of the way. I love this incorporating an amusement park into our day. That’s why we don’t need vacations. Boy, quite a bit of pomp under the circumstances. Well, Adam, today we are men. We are! Bee men. Amen! Hallelujah! Students, faculty, distinguished bees, please welcome Dean Buzzwell. Welcome, New Hive City 
                    <span class="highlight">graduating</span> class of 9:15. That concludes our ceremonies. And begins your career at Honex Industries! Will we pick our job today? I heard it’s just orientation. Heads up! Here we go. Keep your hands and antennas inside the tram at all times. Wonder what it’ll be like? A little scary. Welcome to Honex, a division of Honesco and a part of the Hexagon Group. This is it! Wow. Wow. We know that you, as a bee, have worked your whole life to get to the point where you can work for your whole life. Honey begins when our valiant 
                    <span class="highlight">Pollen</span> Jocks bring the nectar to the hive. Our top secret formula is automatically color corrected, scent adjusted and bubble contoured into this soothing sweet syrup with its distinctive golden glow you know as Honey! That girl was hot. She’s my cousin! She is? Yes, we’re all cousins. Right. You’re right. At Honex, we constantly strive to improve every aspect of bee existence. These bees are stress testing a new helmet technology. What do you think he makes? Not enough. Here we have our latest advancement, the Krelman. What does that do? Catches that little strand of honey that hangs after you pour it. Saves 
                    <span class="highlight">us</span> millions. Can anyone work on the Krelman? Of course. Most bee jobs are small ones. But bees know that every small job, if it’s done well, means a lot. But choose carefully because you’ll stay in the job you pick for the rest of your life. The same job the rest of your life? I didn’t know that. What’s the difference? You’ll be happy to know that bees, as a species, haven’t had one day off in 27 million years. So you’ll just work us to death? We’ll sure try. Wow! That blew my mind! What’s the difference? How 
                    <span class="highlight">can</span> you say that? One job forever? That’s an insane
                    choice to have to make. I’m relieved. Now we only have to make one decision in life. But, Adam, how could they never have told us that? Why would you question anything? We’re bees. We’re the most perfectly functioning society on Earth. You ever think maybe things work a little too well here? Like what? Give me one example. I don’t know. But you know what I’m talking about. Please clear the gate. Royal Nectar Force on approach. Wait a second. Check it out. Hey, those are Pollen Jocks! Wow. 
                    <span class="highlight">I’ve</span> never seen them this close. They know what it’s like outside the hive. Yeah, but some don’t come back. Hey, Jocks! Hi, Jocks! You guys did great! You’re monsters! You’re sky freaks! I love it! I love it! I wonder where they were. I don’t know. Their day’s not planned. Outside the hive, flying who knows where, doing who knows what. You can’t just decide to be a Pollen Jock. You have to be bred for that. Right. Look. That’s more pollen than you and I will see in a lifetime. It’s just a status symbol. Bees make too 
                    <span class="highlight">much</span> of it. Perhaps. Unless you’re wearing it and the ladies see you wearing it. Those ladies? Aren’t they our cousins too? Distant. Distant. Look at these two. Couple of Hive Harrys. Let’s have fun with them. It must be dangerous being a Pollen Jock. Yeah. Once a bear pinned me against a mushroom! He had a paw on my throat, and with the other, he was slapping me! Oh, my! I never thought I’d knock him out. What were you doing during this? Trying to alert the authorities. I can autograph that. A little gusty out there today, wasn’t 
                    <span class="highlight">it,</span> comrades? Yeah. Gusty. We’re hitting a sunflower patch six miles from here tomorrow. Six miles, huh? Barry! A puddle jump for us, but maybe you’re not up for it. Maybe I am. You are not! We’re going 0900 at J Gate. What do you think, buzzy boy? Are you bee enough? I might be. It all depends on what 0900 means. Hey, Honex! Dad, you surprised me. You decide what you’re interested in? Well, there’s a lot of choices. But you only get one. Do you ever get bored doing the same job every day? Son, let me tell you about

                <h4>Alice’s Restaurant</h4>
                <p class="writing">
                    You can get anything you want at Alice’s restaurant You can get anything you want at Alice’s restaurant Walk right in, it’s around the back Just a half a mile from the railroad track You can get anything you want at Alice’s restaurant This song is called "Alice’s Restaurant "It’s about Alice, and the Restaurant, but "Alice’s Restaurant" is not the name of the restaurant, That’s just the name of the song That’s why I call the song "Alice’s Restaurant." Now it all started two Thanksgivings ago, two years ago, on Thanksgiving, When my friend and I went up 
                    <span class="highlight">to</span> visit Alice at the restaurant But Alice doesn’t live in the restaurant, she lives in the church nearby the Restaurant, in the bell tower with her husband Ray and Facha, the dog And livin’ in the bell tower like that, they got a lot of room downstairs Where the pews used to be, and having all that room (seeing as how they took out all the pews), they decided that they didn’t have to take out their Garbage for a long time. We got up here and found all the garbage in there and we decided that it’d Be 
                    <span class="highlight">a</span> friendly gesture for us to take the garbage down to the city dump So we took the half a ton of garbage, put it in the back of a red VW Microbus, took shovels and rakes and implements of destruction, and headed On toward the city dump. Well, we got there and there was a big sign and a Chain across the dump sayin’, "this dump is closed on Thanksgiving, " and We’d never heard of a dump closed on Thanksgiving before, and with tears in Our eyes, we drove off into the sunset looking for another place to put 
                    <span class="highlight">the</span> garbage We didn’t find one till we came to a side road, and off the side of the side Road was another fifteen foot cliff, and at the bottom of the cliff was Another pile of garbage. And we decided that one big pile was better than Two little piles, and rather than bring that one up, we decided to throw Ours down. That’s what we did Drove back to the church, had a Thanksgiving dinner that couldn’t be beat, Went to sleep, and didn’t get up until the next morning, when we got a phone Call from Officer 
                    <span class="highlight">Obie.</span> He said, "kid, we found your name on a envelope at The bottom of a half a ton of garbage and I just wanted to know if you had Any information about it" And I said, "yes sir, Officer Obie, I cannot tell a lie. I put that envelope Under that garbage." After speaking to Obie for about forty five minutes on The telephone, we finally arrived at the truth of the matter and he said That we had to go down and pick up the garbage, and also had to go down and Speak to him at the 
                    <span class="highlight">Police</span> Officer Station. So we got in the red VW microbus With the shovels and rakes and implements of destruction and headed on Toward the Police Officer Station Now, friends, there was only one of two things that Obie could’ve done at The Police Officer Station, and the first was that he could’ve given us a Medal for being so brave and honest on the telephone (which wasn’t very Likely, and we didn’t expect it), and the other thing was that he could’ve Bawled us out and told us never to be seen drivin’ garbage around in the Vicinity again, <span class="highlight">which</span> is what we expected But when we got to the Police Officer Station, there was a third possibility That we hadn’t even counted upon, and we was both immediately arrested, Handcuffed, and I said, "Obie, I can’t pick up the garbage with these here Handcuffs on." He said "shut up kid, and get in the back of the patrol car" And that’s what we did, sat in the back of the patrol car, and drove to The quote scene of the crime unquote I want to tell you ’bout the town of Stockbridge, Massachusetts, where this is Happening’. They 
                    <span class="highlight">got</span> three stop signs, two police officers, and one police Car, but when we got to the scene of the crime, there was five police officers and three police cars, bein’ the biggest crime of the last fifty Years and everybody wanted to get in the newspaper story about it And they was using up all kinds of cop equipment that they had hangin’ Around the Police Officer Station. They was takin’ plaster tire tracks, Footprints, dog smelling’ prints and they took twenty seven 8x10 colored Glossy photographs with circles and arrows and a paragraph on the back of Each 
                    <span class="highlight">one</span> explaining’ what each one was, to be used as evidence against us Took pictures of the approach, the getaway, the northwest corner, the Southwest corner And that’s not to mention the aerial photography! After the ordeal, we went back to the jail. Obie said he was gonna put us in a cell He said "kid, I’m gonna put you in a cell I want your wallet and your belt" I said, "Obie, I can understand your wantin’ my wallet, so I don’t have any Money to spend in the cell, but what do you want my belt for?" and

                <h4>Ultimate Cycle</h4> 
                <p class="writing">This module consists of a screen, eight dials with red labels, and a QWERTY keyboard. The labels on the dials, when decrypted and read from left to right, spell out an eight letter word. The word has been encrypted through a series of ciphers, indicated by the direction each dial is pointing, from left to right. Once deciphered, find the word in the table below, the word written below it is the word that should be entered. Apply the same sequence of encryptions to the response word, and type out the encrypted response word using the keys. The word 
                    <span class="highlight">is</span> automatically submitted when eight keys are pressed. The red button can be pressed at any time before the eighth key is pressed to cancel the input. Inputting any of the eight letters incorrectly will cause a strike to be issued and reset the module. Note: Unless stated otherwise, any reference to a letter’s alphabetic position starts at A equals 1. Similarly, any reference to the position of a dial starts from the leftmost dial equals 1. For each dial: if the number of 45 degree rotations, starting from north, is odd, then the bit given by the dial is 
                    <span class="highlight">1.</span> Otherwise, it is 0. Form four pairs of bits by grouping the bits corresponding to adjacent pairs of dials from left to right. Form another four pair of bits by grouping the bits corresponding to adjacent pairs of dials in reading order. Each of the eight pairs of bits correspond to each of the eight dials from left to right. Using the operator corresponding to the position of the north pointing dial, find the truth values of each pair; the encrypted letter depends on whether each is true or false. Each letter in the word is swapped with the 
                    <span class="highlight">letter</span> with the same alphabetic position in the reversed alphabet. That is, a letter with alphabetic position X will become the letter with alphabetic position 27 minus X. If the LED below the north pointing dial is lit, the Atbash cipher is applied to the input of the Logic cipher. Otherwise, the Atbash cipher is applied to the output of the Logic cipher. Each letter in the word has been shifted forwards through the alphabet by the number of 45 degree clockwise rotations, starting from north, to the direction its corresponding dial is pointing. If the LED corresponding to this 
                    <span class="highlight">dial</span> is lit, each letter is then shifted further by the position of the dial corresponding to this cipher. Otherwise, each letter is then shifted backwards through the alphabet by the position of the dial corresponding to this cipher. The indexing of the lists start at zero. If the last dial is pointing east, use the word corresponding to the number of 45 degree rotations, starting from north, of the first dial. Otherwise, the number of 45 degree rotations, starting from north, of the next dial corresponds to which of the words in the lists below is the keyword for 
                    <span class="highlight">this</span> cipher. If there are less than three unique ports on the bomb, use the keyword from List A. Otherwise, use the keyword from List B. The keyword gives the first ten letters or top two rows of the keysquare. If the LED corresponding to this cipher is unlit, the keyword is entered into the keysquare in reading order. Otherwise, the keyword is entered into the keysquare in reverse reading order. The remaining 15 letters fill the rest of the keysquare in alphabetical order, excluding X, which is never used. The word is split into four pairs of letters. Each 
                    <span class="highlight">pair</span> of letters is altered: If both letters are the same, the encrypted pair is two of the letter diametrically opposite in the keysquare. Otherwise, if both letters belong to the same row of the keysquare, shift both letters one space to the right along the row. Otherwise, if both letters belong to the same column of the keysquare, shift both letters once space down the column. Otherwise, the letters lie on diagonally opposite corners of a rectangle, the encrypted pair consists of the letters in the horizontally opposite corners from the original pair. If the pair of letters is 
                    <span class="highlight">XX,</span> the pair is unchanged by the cipher. If the pair of letters is either XY or YX, where Y is not X, the X is changed to the other letter, forming a double letter pair, and enciphered normally. Then, the new letter is changed back to an X. Each letter is translated using one of the two pigpen ciphers below. Starting from north, the pigpen characters are rotated to face the direction the dial is pointing. The rotated pigpen characters are then translated back, as though they are still facing north, to produce the encrypted letter. If the LED <span class="highlight">corresponding</span> to this cipher is unlit, use cipher I. Otherwise, use cipher II. The indexing of the lists start at 0. For this cipher, the leftmost dial has a position of 0. The two lists give the keywords for two 5x5 keysquares, the keyword from List A is used for the first keysquare and the keyword from List B is used for the second: If the numbers in the serial number add up to more than 9, the keyword in List A is given by the position of dial and the keyword in List B is given by the number 
                    <span class="highlight">of</span> 45 degree rotations, starting from north, of the previous dial. Otherwise, the keyword in List B is given by the position of dial and the keyword in List A is given by the number of 45 degree rotations, starting from north, of the previous dial. If the first dial is pointing south, the ‘previous’ dial is the last dial. These keywords are used to construct two cipher alphabets where each keyword precedes the remaining sixteen letters. For each letter, from left to right, consider the status of the LED below the dial in its position: If the status of

                <h4>The Holy Bible Old Testament</h4>
                <p class="writing">In the beginning God created the heaven and the earth. And the earth was without form, and void; and darkness was upon the face of the deep. And the Spirit of God moved upon the face of the waters. And God said, Let there be light and there was light. And God saw the light, that it was good and God divided the light from the darkness. And God called the light Day, and the darkness he called Night. And the evening and the morning were the first day. And God said, Let there be a firmament in the 
                    <span class="highlight">midst</span> of the waters, and let it divide the waters from the waters. And God made the firmament, and divided the waters which were under the firmament from the waters which were above the firmament and it was so. And God called the firmament Heaven. And the evening and the morning were the second day. And God said, Let the waters under the heaven be gathered together unto one place, and let the dry land appear and it was so. And God called the dry land Earth; and the gathering together of the waters called he Seas and God saw 
                    <span class="highlight">that</span> it was good. And God said, Let the earth bring forth grass, the herb yielding seed, and the fruit tree yielding fruit after his kind, whose seed is in itself, upon the earth and it was so. And the earth brought forth grass, and herb yielding seed after his kind, and the tree yielding fruit, whose seed was in itself, after his kind: and God saw that it was good. And the evening and the morning were the third day. And God said, Let there be lights in the firmament of the heaven to divide the day from the 
                    <span class="highlight">night;</span> and let them be for signs, and for seasons, and for days, and years and let them be for lights in the firmament of the heaven to give light upon the earth and it was so. And God made two great lights; the greater light to rule the day, and the lesser light to rule the night he made the stars also. And God set them in the firmament of the heaven to give light upon the earth, and to rule over the day and over the night, and to divide the light from the darkness and God saw 
                    <span class="highlight">that</span> it was good. And the evening and the morning were the fourth day. And God said, Let the waters bring forth abundantly the moving creature that hath life, and fowl that may fly above the earth in the open firmament of heaven. And God created great whales, and every living creature that moveth, which the waters brought forth abundantly, after their kind, and every winged fowl after his kind: and God saw that it was good. And God blessed them, saying, Be fruitful, and multiply, and fill the waters in the seas, and let fowl multiply in the earth. <span class="highlight">And</span> the evening and the morning were the fifth day. And God said, Let the earth bring forth the living creature after his kind, cattle, and creeping thing, and beast of the earth after his kind: and it was so. And God made the beast of the earth after his kind, and cattle after their kind, and every thing that creepeth upon the earth after his kind: and God saw that it was good. And God said, Let us make man in our image, after our likeness: and let them have dominion over the fish of the sea, and over 
                    <span class="highlight">the</span> fowl of the air, and over the cattle, and over all the earth, and over every creeping thing that creepeth upon the earth. So God created man in his own image, in the image of God created he him; male and female created he them. And God blessed them, and God said unto them, Be fruitful, and multiply, and replenish the earth, and subdue it: and have dominion over the fish of the sea, and over the fowl of the air, and over every living thing that moveth upon the earth. And God said, Behold, I have given you 
                    <span class="highlight">every</span> herb bearing seed, which is upon the face of all the earth, and every tree, in the which is the fruit of a tree yielding seed; to you it shall be for meat. And to every beast of the earth, and to every fowl of the air, and to every thing that creepeth upon the earth, wherein there is life, I have given every green herb for meat: and it was so. And God saw every thing that he had made, and, behold, it was very good. And the evening and the morning were the sixth day. Thus the 
                    <span class="highlight">heavens</span> and the earth were finished, and all the host of them. And on the seventh day God ended his work which he had made; and he rested on the seventh day from all his work which he had made. And God blessed the seventh day, and sanctified it: because that in it he had rested from all his work which God created and made. These are the generations of the heavens and of the earth when they were created, in the day that the Lord God made the earth and the heavens, and every plant of the field before 
                    <span class="highlight">it</span> was in the earth, and every herb of the field before it grew: for the Lord God had not caused it to rain upon the earth, and there was not a man to till the ground. But there went up a mist from the earth, and watered the whole face of the ground. And the Lord God formed man of the dust of the ground, and breathed into his nostrils the breath of life; and man became a living soul. And the Lord God planted a garden eastward in Eden; and there he put the man whom he had 
                    <span class="highlight">formed.</span>

                <h4>How the Grinch Stole Christmas</h4>
                <p class="writing">Every Who Down in Whoville Liked Christmas a lot... But the Grinch, Who lived just north of Whoville, Did NOT! The Grinch hated Christmas! The whole Christmas season! Now, please don’t ask why. No one quite knows the reason. It could be his head wasn’t screwed on just right. It could be, perhaps, that his shoes were too tight. But I think that the most likely reason of all, May have been that his heart was two sizes too small. Whatever the reason, His heart or his shoes, He stood there on Christmas Eve, hating the Whos, Staring down 
                    <span class="highlight">from</span> his cave with a sour, Grinchy frown, At the warm lighted windows below in their town. For he knew every Who down in Whoville beneath, Was busy now, hanging a mistletoe wreath. "And they’re hanging their stockings!" he snarled with a sneer, "Tomorrow is Christmas! It’s practically here!" Then he growled, with his Grinch fingers nervously drumming, "I MUST find some way to stop Christmas from coming!" For Tomorrow, he knew, all the Who girls and boys, Would wake bright and early. They’d rush for their toys! And then! Oh, the noise! Oh, the Noise! Noise! Noise! Noise! That’s 
                    <span class="highlight">one</span> thing he hated! The NOISE! NOISE! NOISE! NOISE! Then the Whos, young and old, would sit down to a feast. And they’d feast! And they’d feast! And they’d FEAST! FEAST! FEAST! FEAST! They would feast on Who pudding, and rare Who roast beast. Which was something the Grinch couldn’t stand in the least! And THEN They’d do something He liked least of all! Every Who down in Whoville, the tall and the small, Would stand close together, with Christmas bells ringing. They’d stand hand in hand. And the Whos would start singing! They’d sing! And they’d sing! And they’d 
                    <span class="highlight">SING!</span> SING! SING! SING! And the more the Grinch thought of this Who Christmas Sing, The more the Grinch thought, "I must stop this whole thing!" "Why, for fifty three years I’ve put up with it now!" "I MUST stop this Christmas from coming! But HOW?" Then he got an idea! An awful idea! THE GRINCH GOT A WONDERFUL, AWFUL IDEA! "I know just what to do!" The Grinch laughed in his throat. And he made a quick Santy Claus hat and a coat. And he chuckled, and clucked, "What a great Grinchy trick!" "With this coat and this hat, 
                    <span class="highlight">I</span> look just like Saint Nick!" "All I need is a reindeer..." The Grinch looked around. But, since reindeer are scarce, there was none to be found. Did that stop the old Grinch? No! The Grinch simply said, "If I can’t find a reindeer, I’ll make one instead!" So he called his dog, Max. Then he took some red thread, And he tied a big horn on the top of his head. THEN He loaded some bags And some old empty sacks, On a ramshackle sleigh And he hitched up old Max. Then the Grinch said, "Giddap!" And the sleigh 
                    <span class="highlight">started</span> down, Toward the homes where the Whos Lay a snooze in their town. All their windows were dark. Quiet snow filled the air. All the Whos were all dreaming sweet dreams without care. When he came to the first little house on the square. "This is stop number one," the old Grinchy Claus hissed, And he climbed to the roof, empty bags in his fist. Then he slid down the chimney. A rather tight pinch. But, if Santa could do it, then so could the Grinch. He got stuck only once, for a moment or two. Then he stuck 
                    <span class="highlight">his</span> head out of the fireplace flue. Where the little Who stockings all hung in a row. "These stockings," he grinned, "are the first things to go!" Then he slithered and slunk, with a smile most unpleasant, Around the whole room, and he took every present! Pop guns! And bicycles! Roller skates! Drums! Checkerboards! Tricycles! Popcorn! And plums! And he stuffed them in bags. Then the Grinch, very nimbly, Stuffed all the bags, one by one, up the chimney! Then he slunk to the icebox. He took the Whos’ feast! He took the Who pudding! He took the roast beast! 
                    <span class="highlight">He</span> cleaned out that icebox as quick as a flash. Why, that Grinch even took their last can of Who hash! Then he stuffed all the food up the chimney with glee. "And NOW!" grinned the Grinch, "I will stuff up the tree!" And the Grinch grabbed the tree, and he started to shove, When he heard a small sound like the coo of a dove. He turned around fast, and he saw a small Who! Little Cindy Lou Who, who was not more than two. The Grinch had been caught by this tiny Who daughter, Who’d got out of 
                    <span class="highlight">bed</span> for a cup of cold water. She stared at the Grinch and said, "Santy Claus, why,” "Why are you taking our Christmas tree? WHY?" But, you know, that old Grinch was so smart and so slick, He thought up a lie, and he thought it up quick! "Why, my sweet little tot," the fake Santy Claus lied, "There’s a light on this tree that won’t light on one side." "So I’m taking it home to my workshop, my dear." "I’ll fix it up there. Then I’ll bring it back here." And his fib fooled the child. Then he patted 
                    <span class="highlight">her</span> head, And he got her a drink and he sent her to bed. And when CindyLou Who went to bed with her cup, HE went to the chimney and stuffed the tree up! Then the last thing he took Was the log for their fire! Then he went up the chimney, himself, the old liar. On their walls he left nothing but hooks and some wire. And the one speck of food That he left in the house, Was a crumb that was even too small for a mouse. Then He did the same thing To the other Whos’

                <h4>Moby Dick</h4>
                <p class="writing">
                    Call me Ishmael. Some years ago never mind how long precisely having little or no money in my purse, and nothing particular to interest me on shore, I thought I would sail about a little and see the watery part of the world. It is a way I have of driving off the spleen and regulating the circulation. Whenever I find myself growing grim about the mouth; whenever it is a damp, drizzly November in my soul; whenever I find myself involuntarily pausing before coffin warehouses, and bringing up the rear of every funeral I meet; and especially whenever 
                    <span class="highlight">my</span> hypos get such an upper hand of me, that it requires a strong moral principle to prevent me from deliberately stepping into the street, and methodically knocking people’s hats off then, I account it high time to get to sea as soon as I can. This is my substitute for pistol and ball. With a philosophical flourish Cato throws himself upon his sword; I quietly take to the ship. There is nothing surprising in this. If they but knew it, almost all men in their degree, some time or other, cherish very nearly the same feelings towards the ocean <span class="highlight">with</span> me. There now is your insular city of the Manhattoes, belted round by wharves as Indian isles by coral reefs commerce surrounds it with her surf. Right and left, the streets take you waterward. Its extreme downtown is the battery, where that noble mole is washed by waves, and cooled by breezes, which a few hours previous were out of sight of land. Look at the crowds of water gazers there. Circumambulate the city of a dreamy Sabbath afternoon. Go from Corlears Hook to Coenties Slip, and from thence, by Whitehall, northward. What do you see? Posted like silent sentinels 
                    <span class="highlight">all</span> around the town, stand thousands upon thousands of mortal men fixed in ocean reveries. Some leaning against the spiles; some seated upon the pier heads; some looking over the bulwarks of ships from China; some high aloft in the rigging, as if striving to get a still better seaward peep. But these are all landsmen; of week days pent up in lath and plaster tied to counters, nailed to benches, clinched to desks. How then is this? Are the green fields gone? What do they here? But look! here come more crowds, pacing straight for the water, and seemingly bound 
                    <span class="highlight">for</span> a dive. Strange! Nothing will content them but the extremest limit of the land; loitering under the shady lee of yonder warehouses will not suffice. No. They must get just as nigh the water as they possibly can without falling in. And there they stand miles of them leagues. Inlanders all, they come from lanes and alleys, streets and avenues north, east, south, and west. Yet here they all unite. Tell me, does the magnetic virtue of the needles of the compasses of all those ships attract them thither? Once more. Say you are in the country; in some 
                    <span class="highlight">high</span> land of lakes. Take almost any path you please, and ten to one it carries you down in a dale, and leaves you there by a pool in the stream. There is magic in it. Let the most absent minded of men be plunged in his deepest reveries stand that man on his legs, set his feet a going, and he will infallibly lead you to water, if water there be in all that region. Should you ever be athirst in the great American desert, try this experiment, if your caravan happen to be supplied with a metaphysical professor. Yes, as 
                    <span class="highlight">everyone</span> knows, meditation and water are wedded forever. But here is an artist. He desires to paint you the dreamiest, shadiest, quietest, most enchanting bit of romantic landscape in all the valley of the Saco. What is the chief element he employs? There stand his trees, each with a hollow trunk, as if a hermit and a crucifix were within; and here sleeps his meadow, and there sleep his cattle; and up from yonder cottage goes a sleepy smoke. Deep into distant woodlands winds a mazy way, reaching to overlapping spurs of mountains bathed in their hill side blue. But though 
                    <span class="highlight">the</span> picture lies thus tranced, and though this pine tree shakes down its sighs like leaves upon this shepherd’s head, yet all were vain, unless the shepherd’s eye were fixed upon the magic stream before him. Go visit the Prairies in June, when for scores on scores of miles you wade knee deep among Tiger lilies what is the one charm wanting? Water there is not a drop of water there! Were Niagara but a cataract of sand, would you travel your thousand miles to see it? Why did the poor poet of Tennessee, upon suddenly receiving two handfuls of silver, deliberate whether 
                    <span class="highlight">to</span> buy him a coat, which he sadly needed, or invest his money in a pedestrian trip to Rockaway Beach? Why is almost every robust healthy boy with a robust healthy soul in him, at some time or other crazy to go to sea? Why upon your first voyage as a passenger, did you yourself feel such a mystical vibration, when first told that you and your ship were now out of sight of land? Why did the old Persians hold the sea holy? Why did the Greeks give it a separate deity, and own brother of Jove? Surely all 
                    <span class="highlight">this</span> is not without meaning. And still deeper the meaning of that story of Narcissus, who because he could not grasp the tormenting, mild image he saw in the fountain, plunged into it and was drowned. But that same image, we ourselves see in all rivers and oceans. It is the image of the ungraspable phantom of life; and this is the key to it all. Now, when I say that I am in the habit of going to sea whenever I begin to grow hazy about the eyes, and begin to be over conscious of my lungs, I do

                <h4>The Raven</h4>
                <p class="writing">
                    Once upon a midnight dreary, while I pondered, weak and weary, Over many a quaint and curious volume of forgotten lore While I nodded, nearly napping, suddenly there came a tapping, As of some one gently rapping, rapping at my chamber door. “’Tis some visitor,” I muttered, “tapping at my chamber door Only this and nothing more.” Ah, distinctly I remember it was in the bleak December; And each separate dying ember wrought its ghost upon the floor. Eagerly I wished the morrow; vainly I had sought to borrow From my books surcease of sorrow sorrow for the lost 
                    <span class="highlight">Lenore</span> For the rare and radiant maiden whom the angels name Lenore Nameless here for evermore. And the silken, sad, uncertain rustling of each purple curtain Thrilled me filled me with fantastic terrors never felt before; So that now, to still the beating of my heart, I stood repeating “’Tis some visitor entreating entrance at my chamber door Some late visitor entreating entrance at my chamber door; This it is and nothing more.” Presently my soul grew stronger; hesitating then no longer, “Sir,” said I, “or Madam, truly your forgiveness I implore; But the fact is I was napping, and <span class="highlight">so</span> gently you came rapping, And so faintly you came tapping, tapping at my chamber door, That I scarce was sure I heard you” here I opened wide the door; Darkness there and nothing more. Deep into that darkness peering, long I stood there wondering, fearing, Doubting, dreaming dreams no mortal ever dared to dream before; But the silence was unbroken, and the stillness gave no token, And the only word there spoken was the whispered word, “Lenore?” This I whispered, and an echo murmured back the word, “Lenore!” Merely this and nothing more. Back into the chamber turning, all 
                    <span class="highlight">my</span> soul within me burning, Soon again I heard a tapping somewhat louder than before. “Surely,” said I, “surely that is something at my window lattice; Let me see, then, what thereat is, and this mystery explore Let my heart be still a moment and this mystery explore; ’Tis the wind and nothing more!” Open here I flung the shutter, when, with many a flirt and flutter, In there stepped a stately Raven of the saintly days of yore; Not the least obeisance made he; not a minute stopped or stayed he; But, with mien of lord or lady, perched 
                    <span class="highlight">above</span> my chamber door Perched upon a bust of Pallas just above my chamber door Perched, and sat, and nothing more. Then this ebony bird beguiling my sad fancy into smiling, By the grave and stern decorum of the countenance it wore, “Though thy crest be shorn and shaven, thou,” I said, “art sure no craven, Ghastly grim and ancient Raven wandering from the Nightly shore Tell me what thy lordly name is on the Night’s Plutonian shore!” Quoth the Raven “Nevermore.” Much I marvelled this ungainly fowl to hear discourse so plainly, Though its answer little meaning little relevancy 
                    <span class="highlight">bore;</span> For we cannot help agreeing that no living human being Ever yet was blessed with seeing bird above his chamber door Bird or beast upon the sculptured bust above his chamber door, With such name as “Nevermore.” But the Raven, sitting lonely on the placid bust, spoke only That one word, as if his soul in that one word he did outpour. Nothing farther then he uttered not a feather then he fluttered Till I scarcely more than muttered “Other friends have flown before On the morrow he will leave me, as my Hopes have flown before.” Then the 
                    <span class="highlight">bird</span> said “Nevermore.” Startled at the stillness broken by reply so aptly spoken, “Doubtless,” said I, “what it utters is its only stock and store Caught from some unhappy master whom unmerciful Disaster Followed fast and followed faster till his songs one burden bore Till the dirges of his Hope that melancholy burden bore Of ‘Never nevermore’.” But the Raven still beguiling all my fancy into smiling, Straight I wheeled a cushioned seat in front of bird, and bust and door; Then, upon the velvet sinking, I betook myself to linking Fancy unto fancy, thinking what this ominous bird of 
                    <span class="highlight">yore</span> What this grim, ungainly, ghastly, gaunt, and ominous bird of yore Meant in croaking “Nevermore.” This I sat engaged in guessing, but no syllable expressing To the fowl whose fiery eyes now burned into my bosom’s core; This and more I sat divining, with my head at ease reclining On the cushion’s velvet lining that the lamp-light gloated o’er, But whose velvet-violet lining with the lamp-light gloating o’er, She shall press, ah, nevermore! Then, methought, the air grew denser, perfumed from an unseen censer Swung by Seraphim whose foot-falls tinkled on the tufted floor. “Wretch,” I cried, “thy God 
                    <span class="highlight">hath</span> lent thee by these angels he hath sent thee Respite respite and nepenthe from thy memories of Lenore; Quaff, oh quaff this kind nepenthe and forget this lost Lenore!” Quoth the Raven “Nevermore.” “Prophet!” said I, “thing of evil! prophet still, if bird or devil! Whether Tempter sent, or whether tempest tossed thee here ashore, Desolate yet all undaunted, on this desert land enchanted On this home by Horror haunted tell me truly, I implore Is there is there balm in Gilead? tell me tell me, I implore!” Quoth the Raven “Nevermore.” “Prophet!” said I, “thing of evil! prophet 
                    <span class="highlight">still,</span> if bird or devil! By that Heaven that bends above us by that God we both adore Tell this soul with sorrow laden if, within the distant Aidenn, It shall clasp a sainted maiden whom the angels name Lenore Clasp a rare and radiant maiden whom the angels name Lenore.” Quoth the Raven “Nevermore.” “Be that word our sign of parting, bird or fiend!” I shrieked, upstarting “Get thee back into the tempest and the Night’s Plutonian shore! Leave no black plume as a token of that lie thy soul hath spoken! Leave my loneliness unbroken! quit the bust <span class="highlight">above...</span>

                <h4>A Window in Time</h4>
                <p class="writing">
                    “So, Professor. You’ve built another time machine.” “This one’s a different approach, Vice Chancellor. This device is quite unlike anything the world has seen before. It allows us to look into the past. Literally.” “Literally?” “It opens a window into any time you choose. You can look through it and see the room you’re standing in, at any point in history. Imagine! You could witness Shakespeare putting the finishing touches to Hamlet. You could see Henry VIII as a fit young sportsman. You could watch Leonardo painting the Mona Lisa.” “A window, you say?” “Yes. A small window, at 
                    <span class="highlight">the</span> moment. About two centimetres in diameter. And we only have enough power to keep it open for four seconds at a time. But still, imagine the benefit to history! To archaeology! To palaeontology!” The Vice Chancellor scratched his chin, imagining the potential benefits for the college. And lamenting the professor’s lack of commercial acumen. “A window, though? Tell me does this window open?” “I’m not sure what you mean, Vice Chancellor.” “Does this window allow you to pass things through it?” Professor Armstrong gaped at the college principal. “Well,” he said, “I don’t see why not. I mean, 
                    <span class="highlight">it’s</span> not like there’s glass or anything. I suppose it’s possible. Yes, it’s certainly possible.” The Vice Chancellor jumped to his feet. “But this is fantastic!” he said, knocking a Wedgwood tea cup to the floor. “Don’t you see the potential?” “Um,” said Professor Armstrong. “Well, I suppose we could... well, we could steal one of Leonardo’s paint brushes. We could take one of Shakespeare’s quills. Michelangelo’s chisel. A lock of Henry VIII’s hair. I suppose there’s some academic value in those items. But we’ve only got four seconds, and it’s only a small window.” “But can you pass something 
                    <span class="highlight">through</span> it the other way?” “The other way? You mean, like sending Shakespeare a ballpoint pen? Giving Leonardo a tube of gouache? Well, I don’t see why not.” “No, Professor. If you have the technology, there’s only one serious use for it.” “Oh, yes?” “We have to shoot Hitler.” The college paid for the trip to Berchtesgarten, and a vintage Luger. The Vice Chancellor had done some research despite being seriously out of practice and had decided on 16th September 1938 at the Kehlsteinhaus, built to honour Hitler’s 50th birthday. “I’m really not sure about this, Vice Chancellor.” 
                    <span class="highlight">“Nonsense,</span> Professor. We’ll be doing the world a tremendous service. Possibly the greatest service anyone could ever do. Just think with one shot we can prevent the Second World War from ever having taken place! Think of the lives we’ll save. Think of the misery we’ll avert.” And think of the Nobel Peace Prize, he thought. Think of the book royalties, the TV interviews, the likely honours. “But Vice Chancellor,” said the professor, “we might do untold damage. You can’t just change the past. There will be repercussions.” “Trust me, Professor. I understand these things.” And so the professor
                    <span class="highlight">reluctantly</span> opened his laptop, set the time to 1445 and the date to 16th September, and started to fine-tune the controls. “It’s ready,” he announced. “But remember, you only get four seconds.” “That will be enough,” said the Vice Chancellor, gripping the Luger with both hands and aiming down the sight. “Just leave it to me.” The professor hit the Enter key, and the machine hummed into life. A pink disc hovered in the air, and gradually brightened as a strong smell of ammonia filled the room. “Three... two... one... now!” And as the disc turned transparent, the Vice Chancellor 
                    <span class="highlight">clearly</span> saw Adolf Hitler standing at the window. He squeezed the trigger, heard a deafening bang, and had just time to see Hitler collapse before the disc vanished out of existence and the laptop toppled to the floor. He turned to the professor, beaming. “We’ve done it,” he gasped. They heard the sound of running feet in the passageway outside, and the door was flung open by the manager of the Berchtesgarten. “Meinen Herren,” he announced, breathlessly, “is everything well? I have a loud noise heard, wie ein Kanonenschuss. How you say it, a gun bang.” “No, no, everything’s fine,” 
                    <span class="highlight">said</span> the Vice Chancellor, hiding the Luger behind his back. “My colleague just dropped his laptop on the stone floor.” “Was ist? Ich verstehe nicht. I do not this ‘loptap’ understand.” “His PC. His personal computer.” The manager looked confused, so the Vice Chancellor moved aside and gestured to the flagstoned floor. But there was nothing there. “Professor? Where is the laptop?” Professor Armstrong stared at the floor, shaking his head. “It’s as I feared,” he said. “If we averted the war, or even delayed it by a few years, then we may also have prevented the vast government funding 
                    <span class="highlight">that</span> was pumped into Alan Turing’s cryptanalysis research at Bletchley Park. Without that, computing would have been set back decades. Which means the world has yet to invent the laptop. Perhaps even the computer itself.” He felt in his pocket, fingers scrabbling in the void. “Which means we have no smartphones, either.” The Vice Chancellor turned to the hotel manager. “Forgive me,” he said, “but I have a very poor memory. Can you tell me, how many world wars have there been?” The manager stared at him, then started to giggle. Then collapsed into a great belly laugh, his great 
                    <span class="highlight">belly</span> wobbling with amusement. “Why, two, of course,” he spluttered between bouts of hysterics. “Oh, diese Englander, se sind sehr lustig. Your well-known British humour, nein?” The Vice Chancellor slumped into a chair, and gazed at the professor, who stood forlornly staring out of the window. “Well,” he said, “it was worth a try. We might have made the world a better place.” He stood up, took the shell-shocked professor by the arm, and steered him towards the door. “Thank you, Herr Manager,” he said quietly. “You’ve been most helpful.” “It is nothing,” replied the manager, turning to leave. “Heil 
                    <span class="highlight">Himmler!</span>”

                <h4>The Tell-Tale Heart</h4>
                <p class="writing">
                    True! nervous very, very dreadfully nervous I had been and am; but why will you say that I am mad? The disease had sharpened my senses not destroyed not dulled them. Above all was the sense of hearing acute. I heard all things in the heaven and in the earth. I heard many things in hell. How, then, am I mad? Hearken! and observe how healthily how calmly I can tell you the whole story. It is impossible to say how first the idea entered my brain; but once conceived, it haunted me day and night. Object there was 
                    <span class="highlight">none.</span> Passion there was none. I loved the old man. He had never wronged me. He had never given me insult. For his gold I had no desire. I think it was his eye! yes, it was this! He had the eye of a vulture a pale blue eye, with a film over it. Whenever it fell upon me, my blood ran cold; and so by degrees very gradually I made up my mind to take the life of the old man, and thus rid myself of the eye forever. Now this is the point. You fancy me mad. Madmen 
                    <span class="highlight">know</span> nothing. But you should have seen me. You should have seen how wisely I proceeded with what caution with what foresight with what dissimulation I went to work! I was never kinder to the old man than during the whole week before I killed him. And every night, about midnight, I turned the latch of his door and opened it oh so gently! And then, when I had made an opening sufficient for my head, I put in a dark lantern, all closed, closed, that no light shone out, and then I thrust in my head. Oh, you would 
                    <span class="highlight">have</span> laughed to see how cunningly I thrust it in! I moved it slowly very, very slowly, so that I might not disturb the old man’s sleep. It took me an hour to place my whole head within the opening so far that I could see him as he lay upon his bed. Ha! would a madman have been so wise as this, And then, when my head was well in the room, I undid the lantern cautiously-oh, so cautiously cautiously (for the hinges creaked) I undid it just so much that a single thin ray fell upon the vulture 
                    <span class="highlight">eye.</span> And this I did for seven long nights every night just at midnight but I found the eye always closed; and so it was impossible to do the work; for it was not the old man who vexed me, but his Evil Eye. And every morning, when the day broke, I went boldly into the chamber, and spoke courageously to him, calling him by name in a hearty tone, and inquiring how he has passed the night. So you see he would have been a very profound old man, indeed, to suspect that every night, just at twelve, I 
                    <span class="highlight">looked</span> in upon him while he slept. Upon the eighth night I was more than usually cautious in opening the door. A watch’s minute hand moves more quickly than did mine. Never before that night had I felt the extent of my own powers of my sagacity. I could scarcely contain my feelings of triumph. To think that there I was, opening the door, little by little, and he not even to dream of my secret deeds or thoughts. I fairly chuckled at the idea; and perhaps he heard me; for he moved on the bed suddenly, as if startled. 
                    <span class="highlight">Now</span> you may think that I drew back but no. His room was as black as pitch with the thick darkness, (for the shutters were close fastened, through fear of robbers,) and so I knew that he could not see the opening of the door, and I kept pushing it on steadily, steadily. I had my head in, and was about to open the lantern, when my thumb slipped upon the tin fastening, and the old man sprang up in bed, crying out "Who’s there?" I kept quite still and said nothing. For a whole hour I did not move 
                    <span class="highlight">a</span> muscle, and in the meantime I did not hear him lie down. He was still sitting up in the bed listening; just as I have done, night after night, hearkening to the death watches in the wall. Presently I heard a slight groan, and I knew it was the groan of mortal terror. It was not a groan of pain or of grief oh, no! it was the low stifled sound that arises from the bottom of the soul when overcharged with awe. I knew the sound well. Many a night, just at midnight, when all the world slept, 
                    <span class="highlight">it</span> has welled up from my own bosom, deepening, with its dreadful echo, the terrors that distracted me. I say I knew it well. I knew what the old man felt, and pitied him, although I chuckled at heart. I knew that he had been lying awake ever since the first slight noise, when he had turned in the bed. His fears had been ever since growing upon him. He had been trying to fancy them causeless, but could not. He had been saying to himself "It is nothing but the wind in the chimney it is only a mouse 
                    <span class="highlight">crossing</span> the floor," or "It is merely a cricket which has made a single chirp." Yes, he had been trying to comfort himself with these suppositions: but he had found all in vain. All in vain; because Death, in approaching him had stalked with his black shadow before him, and enveloped the victim. And it was the mournful influence of the unperceived shadow that caused him to feel although he neither saw nor heard to feel the presence of my head within the room. When I had waited a long time, very patiently, without hearing him lie down, I resolved <span class="highlight">to...</span>

                <p class="writing">
                    Once upon a time there was a lovely princess. But she had an enchantment upon her of a fearful sort, which could only be broken by Love’s first kiss. She was locked away in a castle guarded by a terrible fire breathing dragon. Many brave knights had attempted to free her from this dreadful prison, but none prevailed. She waited in the dragon’s keep in the highest room of the tallest tower for her true love and true love’s first kiss. Like that’s ever going to happen. Somebody once told me the world is gonna roll me I ain’t 
                    <span class="highlight">the</span> sharpest tool in the shed She was lookin’ kind of dumb with her finger and her thumb In the shape of an "L" on her forehead The years start comin’ and they don’t stop comin’ Fed to the rules and hit the ground runnin’ Didn’t make sense not to live for fun Your brain gets smart but your head gets dumb So much to do so much to see So what’s wrong with takin’ the backstreets You’ll never know if you don’t go, You’ll never shine if you don’t glow Hey, now You’re an all star Get your game 
                    <span class="highlight">on,</span> go play Hey, now You’re a rock star Get the show on, get paid And all that glitters is gold Only shootin’ stars break the mold It’s a cool place and they say it gets colder You’re bundled up now but wait till you get older But the meteor men beg to differ Judging by the hole in the satellite picture The ice we skate is gettin’ pretty thin The water’s getting warm so you might as well swim My world’s on fire How ’bout yours That’s the way I like it and I’ll never get bored Hey, now, 
                    <span class="highlight">you’re</span> an all star Get your game on, go play Hey, now You’re a rock star Get the show on, get paid And all that glitters is gold Only shootin’ stars break the mold Hey, now, you’re an all star Get your game on, go play Hey, now You’re a rock star Get the show on, get paid And all that glitters is gold Only shootin’ stars break the mold. Think he’s in here? All right. Lets get it! Hold on. Do you know what that thing can do to you? Yeah. He’ll groan into your bones for his brains.
                    <span class="highlight">Well</span> actually that would be a giant. Now Ogres, huh, they are much worse. They’ll make a soup from your freshly peeled skin. They’ll chew your livers, squeeze the jelly from your eyes. Actually, it’s quite good on toast. Back, back beast, back! I warned you! Right. This is the part, where you run away. Yeah! And stay out. Wanted. Fairytale creatures. Right, this one is full. Take it away. Give me that. Your fine days are over. -25 pieces of silver for the witch. Next. -Come on. Sit down there! And be quiet! This cage is so small. You 
                    <span class="highlight">wouldn’t</span> turn me in. I’ll never be stubborn again. I can change. Please, give me another chance. Oh, shut up! Next. What do we got? This little wooden puppet. I’m not a puppet, I’m a real boy. Five shillings for the possessed toy. Take it away. No! Please, don’t let them do it! Next. What do you got? Well, I’ve got a talking donkey! Right. Well that’s good for ten shillings, if you can prove it. Oh, go ahead fella. Well? He’s just a li..., just a little nervous. He’s really quite a chatterbox. You boneheaded donkey! That’s it. I 
                    <span class="highlight">have</span> heard enough. Guards! No, no, he talks, he does! I can talk. I love to talk. I’ve talked to... Get her out of my sight! -No, no, I swear! Hey, I can fly. -He can fly! -He can fly! He can talk! -That’s right, fool! Now I’m a flying, talking donkey! You might have seen a housefly, maybe even a superfly. But I bet you ain’t never seen a donkey fly! Seize him! Get him! This way! Hurry! You there. Ogre. -I. By the order of lord Farquaad. I am authorized to place you both under arrest. And transport 
                    <span class="highlight">you</span> to a designated resettlement facility. Oh really? You and what army? Can I say something to you? Listen, you were really, really something, back there. Incredible. Are you talking to... ...me? Yes, I was talking to you. Can I just tell you that you were really great back there with those guards. They thought that was all over there. And then you showed up and BAM. There was tripping over themselves like babes in the woods. That really made me feel good to see that. Oh, that’s great. Really. Man, it’s good to be free. Now, why don’t you <span class="highlight">go</span> celebrate your freedom with your own friends? But I... I don’t have any friends. And I’m not going out there by myself. Hey wait a minute. I have a great idea... I’ll stick with you. You and me are a green fighting machine. Together we’ll scare the spin if anybody crosses us. Oh, a, that was really scary. Maybe you don’t mind me saying. If that doesn’t work, your breath will certainly get the job done, ’cause... you definitely need some tic-tac or something, ’cause your breath stinks! Man you’ve hit my note! Just like the time. and then
                    <span class="highlight">I</span> ate some rotten berries. Man I had some strong gases leaking out of my butt that day. Why are you following me? I’ll tell you why. ’Cause I’m all alone, there is no one here, beside me. My problems have all gone. There’s no one to derive me. But you got to have free ... -Stop singing! Well, it’s no wonder, you don’t have any friends. Wow! Only a true friend would be that truly honest. Listen! Little donkey. Take a look at me! What am I? A... really tall? No! I’m an Ogre.

                <h4>The Vanilla Manual</h4>
                <p class="writing">
                    Welcome to the dangerous and challenging world of bomb defusing. Study this manual carefully; you are the expert. In these pages you will find everything you need to know to defuse even the most insidious of bombs. And remember — One small oversight and it could all be over! Defusing Bombs A bomb will explode when its countdown timer reaches 0 or when too many strikes have been recorded. The only way to defuse a bomb is to disarm all of its modules before its countdown timer expires. Modules Each bomb will include up to 11 modules that must 
                    <span class="highlight">be</span> disarmed. Each module is discrete and can be disarmed in any order. Instructions for disarming modules can be found in Section 1. "Needy" modules present a special case and are described in Section 2. Strikes When the Defuser makes a mistake, the bomb will record a strike which will be displayed on the indicator above the countdown timer. Bombs with a strike indicator will explode upon the third strike. The timer will begin to count down faster after a strike has been recorded. If no strike indicator is present above the countdown timer, the bomb will explode upon the 
                    <span class="highlight">first</span> strike, leaving no room for error. Gathering Information Some disarming instructions will require specific information about the bomb, such as the serial number. This type of information can typically be found on the top, bottom, or sides of the bomb casing. See Appendix A, B, and C for identification instructions that will be useful in disarming certain modules. Section 1: Modules Modules can be identified by an LED in the top right corner. When this LED is lit green, the module has been disarmed. All modules must be disarmed to defuse the bomb. On the Subject of Wires Wires 
                    <span class="highlight">are</span> the lifeblood of electronics! Wait, no, electricity is the lifeblood. Wires are more like the arteries. The veins? No matter... A wire module can have 3-6 wires on it. Only the one correct wire needs to be cut to disarm the module. Wire ordering begins with the first on the top. 3 wires: If there are no red wires, cut the second wire. Otherwise, if the last wire is white, cut the last wire. Otherwise, if there is more than one blue wire, cut the last blue wire. Otherwise, cut the last wire. 4 wires: If there is more 
                    <span class="highlight">than</span> one red wire and the last digit of the serial number is odd, cut the last red wire. Otherwise, if the last wire is yellow and there are no red wires, cut the first wire. Otherwise, if there is exactly one blue wire, cut the first wire. Otherwise, if there is more than one yellow wire, cut the last wire. Otherwise, cut the second wire. 5 wires: If the last wire is black and the last digit of the serial number is odd, cut the fourth wire. Otherwise, if there is exactly one red wire and there is more 
                    <span class="highlight">than</span> one yellow wire, cut the first wire. Otherwise, if there are no black wires, cut the second wire. Otherwise, cut the first wire. 6 wires: If there are no yellow wires and the last digit of the serial number is odd, cut the third wire. Otherwise, if there is exactly one yellow wire and there is more than one white wire, cut the fourth wire. Otherwise, if there are no red wires, cut the last wire. Otherwise, cut the fourth wire. On the Subject of The Button You might think that a button telling you to press it is 
                    <span class="highlight">pretty</span> straightforward. That’s the kind of thinking that gets people exploded. See Appendix A for indicator identification reference. See Appendix B for battery identification reference. Follow these rules in the order they are listed. Perform the first action that applies: If the button is blue and the button says "Abort", hold the button and refer to "Releasing a Held Button". If there is more than 1 battery on the bomb and the button says "Detonate", press and immediately release the button. If the button is white and there is a lit indicator with label CAR, hold the button and refer 
                    <span class="highlight">to</span> "Releasing a Held Button". If there are more than 2 batteries on the bomb and there is a lit indicator with label FRK, press and immediately release the button. If the button is yellow, hold the button and refer to "Releasing a Held Button". If the button is red and the button says "Hold", press and immediately release the button. If none of the above apply, hold the button and refer to "Releasing a Held Button". Releasing a Held Button If you start holding the button down, a colored strip will light up on the right side of the 
                    <span class="highlight">module.</span> Based on its color, you must release the button at a specific point in time: Blue strip: release when the countdown timer has a 4 in any position. White strip: release when the countdown timer has a 1 in any position. Yellow strip: release when the countdown timer has a 5 in any position. Any other color strip: release when the countdown timer has a 1 in any position. On the Subject of Keypads I’m not sure what these symbols are, but I suspect they have something to do with occult. Only one column below has all four of 
                    <span class="highlight">the</span> symbols from the keypad. Press the four buttons in the order their symbols appear from top to bottom within that column. On the Subject of Simon Says This is like one of those toys you played with as a kid where you have to match the pattern that appears, except this one is a knockoff that was probably purchased at a dollar store. One of the four colored buttons will flash. Using the correct table below, press the button with the corresponding color. The original button will flash, followed by another. Repeat this sequence in order using the color

                <h4>The Communist Manifesto (translated to english)</h4>
                <p class="writing">
                    The history of all hitherto existing society †is the history of class struggles. Freeman and slave, patrician and plebeian, lord and serf, guild master ‡and journeyman, in a word, oppressor and oppressed, stood in constant opposition to one another, carried on an uninterrupted, now hidden, now open fight, a fight that each time ended, either in a revolutionary reconstitution of society at large, or in the common ruin of the contending classes. In the earlier epochs of history, we find almost everywhere a complicated arrangement of society into various orders, a manifold gradation of social rank. In ancient Rome 
                    <span class="highlight">we</span> have patricians, knights, plebeians, slaves; in the Middle Ages, feudal lords, vassals, guild masters, journeymen, apprentices, serfs; in almost all of these classes, again, subordinate gradations. The modern bourgeois society that has sprouted from the ruins of feudal society has not done away with class antagonisms. It has but established new classes, new conditions of oppression, new forms of struggle in place of the old ones. Our epoch, the epoch of the bourgeoisie, possesses, however, this distinct feature: it has simplified class antagonisms. Society as a whole is more and more splitting up into two great hostile camps, into 
                    <span class="highlight">two</span> great classes directly facing each other Bourgeoisie and Proletariat. From the serfs of the Middle Ages sprang the chartered burghers of the earliest towns. From these burgesses the first elements of the bourgeoisie were developed. The discovery of America, the rounding of the Cape, opened up fresh ground for the rising bourgeoisie. The East Indian and Chinese markets, the colonisation of America, trade with the colonies, the increase in the means of exchange and in commodities generally, gave to commerce, to navigation, to industry, an impulse never before known, and thereby, to the revolutionary element in the tottering 
                    <span class="highlight">feudal</span> society, a rapid development. The feudal system of industry, in which industrial production was monopolised by closed guilds, now no longer sufficed for the growing wants of the new markets. The manufacturing system took its place. The guild masters were pushed on one side by the manufacturing middle class; division of labour between the different corporate guilds vanished in the face of division of labour in each single workshop. Meantime the markets kept ever growing, the demand ever rising. Even manufacturer no longer sufficed. Thereupon, steam and machinery revolutionised industrial production. The place of manufacture was taken by the 
                    <span class="highlight">giant,</span> Modern Industry; the place of the industrial middle class by industrial millionaires, the leaders of the whole industrial armies, the modern bourgeois. Modern industry has established the world market, for which the discovery of America paved the way. This market has given an immense development to commerce, to navigation, to communication by land. This development has, in its turn, reacted on the extension of industry; and in proportion as industry, commerce, navigation, railways extended, in the same proportion the bourgeoisie developed, increased its capital, and pushed into the background every class handed down from the Middle Ages. We see, 
                    <span class="highlight">therefore,</span> how the modern bourgeoisie is itself the product of a long course of development, of a series of revolutions in the modes of production and of exchange. Each step in the development of the bourgeoisie was accompanied by a corresponding political advance of that class. An oppressed class under the sway of the feudal nobility, an armed and self governing association in the medieval commune here independent urban republic (as in Italy and Germany); there taxable “third estate” of the monarchy (as in France); afterwards, in the period of manufacturing proper, serving either the semi feudal or the absolute 
                    <span class="highlight">monarchy</span> as a counterpoise against the nobility, and, in fact, cornerstone of the great monarchies in general, the bourgeoisie has at last, since the establishment of Modern Industry and of the world market, conquered for itself, in the modern representative State, exclusive political sway. The executive of the modern state is but a committee for managing the common affairs of the whole bourgeoisie. The bourgeoisie, historically, has played a most revolutionary part. The bourgeoisie, wherever it has got the upper hand, has put an end to all feudal, patriarchal, idyllic relations. It has pitilessly torn asunder the motley feudal ties 
                    <span class="highlight">that</span> bound man to his “natural superiors”, and has left remaining no other nexus between man and man than naked self interest, than callous “cash payment”. It has drowned the most heavenly ecstasies of religious fervour, of chivalrous enthusiasm, of philistine sentimentalism, in the icy water of egotistical calculation. It has resolved personal worth into exchange value, and in place of the numberless indefeasible chartered freedoms, has set up that single, unconscionable freedom and Free Trade. In one word, for exploitation, veiled by religious and political illusions, it has substituted naked, shameless, direct, brutal exploitation. The bourgeoisie has stripped of 
                    <span class="highlight">its</span> halo every occupation hitherto honoured and looked up to with reverent awe. It has converted the physician, the lawyer, the priest, the poet, the man of science, into its paid wage labourers. The bourgeoisie has torn away from the family its sentimental veil, and has reduced the family relation to a mere money relation. The bourgeoisie has disclosed how it came to pass that the brutal display of vigour in the Middle Ages, which reactionaries so much admire, found its fitting complement in the most slothful indolence. It has been the first to show what man’s activity can bring 
                    <span class="highlight">about.</span> It has accomplished wonders far surpassing Egyptian pyramids, Roman aqueducts, and Gothic cathedrals; it has conducted expeditions that put in the shade all former Exoduses of nations and crusades. The bourgeoisie cannot exist without constantly revolutionising the instruments of production, and thereby the relations of production, and with them the whole relations of society. Conservation of the old modes of production in unaltered form, was, on the contrary, the first condition of existence for all earlier industrial classes. Constant revolutionising of production, uninterrupted disturbance of all social conditions, everlasting uncertainty and agitation distinguish the bourgeois epoch from all earlier 
                    <span class="highlight">ones.</span>

                <h4>The Declaration of Independence</h4>
                <p class="writing">
                    The unanimous Declaration of the thirteen united States of America, When in the Course of human events, it becomes necessary for one people to dissolve the political bands which have connected them with another, and to assume among the powers of the earth, the separate and equal station to which the Laws of Nature and of Nature’s God entitle them, a decent respect to the opinions of mankind requires that they should declare the causes which impel them to the separation. We hold these truths to be self-evident, that all men are created equal, that they are endowed by 
                    <span class="highlight">their</span> Creator with certain unalienable Rights, that among these are Life, Liberty and the pursuit of Happiness. That to secure these rights, Governments are instituted among Men, deriving their just powers from the consent of the governed, That whenever any Form of Government becomes destructive of these ends, it is the Right of the People to alter or to abolish it, and to institute new Government, laying its foundation on such principles and organizing its powers in such form, as to them shall seem most likely to effect their Safety and Happiness. Prudence, indeed, will dictate that Governments long established 
                    <span class="highlight">should</span> not be changed for light and transient causes; and accordingly all experience hath shewn, that mankind are more disposed to suffer, while evils are sufferable, than to right themselves by abolishing the forms to which they are accustomed. But when a long train of abuses and usurpations, pursuing invariably the same Object evinces a design to reduce them under absolute Despotism, it is their right, it is their duty, to throw off such Government, and to provide new Guards for their future security. Such has been the patient sufferance of these Colonies; and such is now the necessity which 
                    <span class="highlight">constrains</span> them to alter their former Systems of Government. The history of the present King of Great Britain is a history of repeated injuries and usurpations, all having in direct object the establishment of an absolute Tyranny over these States. To prove this, let Facts be submitted to a candid world. He has refused his Assent to Laws, the most wholesome and necessary for the public good. He has forbidden his Governors to pass Laws of immediate and pressing importance, unless suspended in their operation till his Assent should be obtained; and when so suspended, he has utterly neglected to 
                    <span class="highlight">attend</span> to them. He has refused to pass other Laws for the accommodation of large districts of people, unless those people would relinquish the right of Representation in the Legislature, a right inestimable to them and formidable to tyrants only. He has called together legislative bodies at places unusual, uncomfortable, and distant from the depository of their public Records, for the sole purpose of fatiguing them into compliance with his measures. He has dissolved Representative Houses repeatedly, for opposing with manly firmness his invasions on the rights of the people. He has refused for a long time, after such dissolutions, 
                    <span class="highlight">to</span> cause others to be elected; whereby the Legislative powers, incapable of Annihilation, have returned to the People at large for their exercise; the State remaining in the mean time exposed to all the dangers of invasion from without, and convulsions within. He has endeavoured to prevent the population of these States; for that purpose obstructing the Laws for Naturalization of Foreigners; refusing to pass others to encourage their migrations hither, and raising the conditions of new Appropriations of Lands. He has obstructed the Administration of Justice, by refusing his Assent to Laws for establishing Judiciary powers. He has made <span class="highlight">Judges</span> dependent on his Will alone, for the tenure of their offices, and the amount and payment of their salaries. He has erected a multitude of New Offices, and sent hither swarms of Officers to harrass our people, and eat out their substance. He has kept among us, in times of peace, Standing Armies without the Consent of our legislatures. He has affected to render the Military independent of and superior to the Civil power. He has combined with others to subject us to a jurisdiction foreign to our constitution, and unacknowledged by our laws; giving his Assent to their 
                    <span class="highlight">Acts</span> of pretended Legislation: For Quartering large bodies of armed troops among us: For protecting them, by a mock Trial, from punishment for any Murders which they should commit on the Inhabitants of these States: For cutting off our Trade with all parts of the world: For imposing Taxes on us without our Consent: For depriving us in many cases, of the benefits of Trial by Jury: For transporting us beyond Seas to be tried for pretended offences, For abolishing the free System of English Laws in a neighbouring Province, establishing therein an Arbitrary government, and enlarging its Boundaries so 
                    <span class="highlight">as</span> to render it at once an example and fit instrument for introducing the same absolute rule into these Colonies: For taking away our Charters, abolishing our most valuable Laws, and altering fundamentally the Forms of our Governments: For suspending our own Legislatures, and declaring themselves invested with power to legislate for us in all cases whatsoever. He has abdicated Government here, by declaring us out of his Protection and waging War against us. He has plundered our seas, ravaged our Coasts, burnt our towns, and destroyed the lives of our people. He is at this time transporting large Armies 
                    <span class="highlight">of</span> foreign Mercenaries to compleat the works of death, desolation and tyranny, already begun with circumstances of Cruelty and perfidy scarcely paralleled in the most barbarous ages, and totally unworthy the Head of a civilized nation. He has constrained our fellow Citizens taken Captive on the high Seas to bear Arms against their Country, to become the executioners of their friends and Brethren, or to fall themselves by their Hands. He has excited domestic insurrections amongst us, and has endeavoured to bring on the inhabitants of our frontiers, the merciless Indian Savages, whose known rule of warfare, is an undistinguished 
                    <span class="highlight">destruction...</span>

                <h4>The Holy Bible New Testament</h4>
                <p class=" writing">
                    The book of the generation of Jesus Christ, the son of David, the son of Abraham. Abraham begat Isaac; and Isaac begat Jacob; and Jacob begat Judah and his brethren; and Judah begat Pharez and Zerah of Tamar; and Pharez begat Hezron; and Hezron begat Ram; and Ram begat Amminadab; and Amminadab begat Nahshon; and Nahshon begat Salmon; and Salmon begat Boaz of Rachab; and Boaz begat Obed of Ruth; and Obed begat Jesse; and Jesse begat David the king. And David the king begat Solomon of her that had been the wife of Uriah; and Solomon begat Rehoboam; 
                    <span class="highlight">and</span> Rehoboam begat Abijah; and Abijah begat Asa; and Asa begat Jehoshaphat; and Jehoshaphat begat Jehoram; and Jehoram begat Uzziah; and Uzziah begat Jotham; and Jotham begat Ahaz; and Ahaz begat Hezekiah; and Hezekiah begat Manasseh; and Manasseh begat Amon; and Amon begat Josiah; and Josiah begat Jeconiah and his brethren, about the time they were carried away to Babylon. And after they were brought to Babylon, Jeconiah begat Shealtiel; and Shealtiel begat Zerubbabel; and Zerubbabel begat Abiud; and Abiud begat Eliakim; and Eliakim begat Azor; and Azor begat Zadok; and Zadok begat Achim; and Achim begat Eliud; and Eliud 
                    <span class="highlight">begat</span> Eleazar; and Eleazar begat Matthan; and Matthan begat Jacob; and Jacob begat Joseph the husband of Mary, of whom was born Jesus, who is called Christ. So all the generations from Abraham to David are fourteen generations; and from David until the carrying away into Babylon are fourteen generations; and from the carrying away into Babylon unto Christ are fourteen generations. Now the birth of Jesus Christ was on this wise: When as his mother Mary was espoused to Joseph, before they came together, she was found with child of the Holy Ghost. Then Joseph her husband, being a 
                    <span class="highlight">just</span> man, and not willing to make her a public example, was minded to put her away privily. But while he thought on these things, behold, the angel of the Lord appeared unto him in a dream, saying, Joseph, thou son of David, fear not to take unto thee Mary thy wife: for that which is conceived in her is of the Holy Ghost. And she shall bring forth a son, and thou shalt call his name Jesus: for he shall save his people from their sins. Now all this was done, that it might be fulfilled which was spoken 
                    <span class="highlight">of</span> the Lord by the prophet, saying, Behold, a virgin shall be with child, and shall bring forth a son, and they shall call his name Immanuel, which being interpreted is, God with us. Then Joseph being raised from sleep did as the angel of the Lord had bidden him, and took unto him his wife: and knew her not till she had brought forth her firstborn son: and he called his name Jesus. Now when Jesus was born in Bethlehem of Judea in the days of Herod the king, behold, there came wise men from the east to Jerusalem, 
                    <span class="highlight">saying,</span> Where is he that is born King of the Jews? for we have seen his star in the east, and are come to worship him. When Herod the king had heard these things, he was troubled, and all Jerusalem with him. And when he had gathered all the chief priests and scribes of the people together, he demanded of them where Christ should be born. And they said unto him, In Bethlehem of Judea: for thus it is written by the prophet, And thou Bethlehem, in the land of Judah, art not the least among the princes of Judah: 
                    <span class="highlight">for</span> out of thee shall come a Governor, that shall rule my people Israel. Then Herod, when he had privily called the wise men, inquired of them diligently what time the star appeared. And he sent them to Bethlehem, and said, Go and search diligently for the young child; and when ye have found him, bring me word again, that I may come and worship him also. When they had heard the king, they departed; and, lo, the star, which they saw in the east, went before them, till it came and stood over where the young child was. When
                    <span class="highlight">they</span> saw the star, they rejoiced with exceeding great joy. And when they were come into the house, they saw the young child with Mary his mother, and fell down, and worshipped him: and when they had opened their treasures, they presented unto him gifts; gold, and frankincense, and myrrh. And being warned of God in a dream that they should not return to Herod, they departed into their own country another way. And when they were departed, behold, the angel of the Lord appeareth to Joseph in a dream, saying, Arise, and take the young child and his mother, 
                    <span class="highlight">and</span> flee into Egypt, and be thou there until I bring thee word: for Herod will seek the young child to destroy him. When he arose, he took the young child and his mother by night, and departed into Egypt: and was there until the death of Herod: that it might be fulfilled which was spoken of the Lord by the prophet, saying, Out of Egypt have I called my son. Then Herod, when he saw that he was mocked of the wise men, was exceeding wroth, and sent forth, and slew all the children that were in Bethlehem, and 
                    <span class="highlight">in</span> all the coasts thereof, from two years old and under, according to the time which he had diligently inquired of the wise men. Then was fulfilled that which was spoken by Jeremiah the prophet, saying, In Ramah was there a voice heard, lamentation, and weeping, and great mourning, Rachel weeping for her children, and would not be comforted, because they are not. But when Herod was dead, behold, an angel of the Lord appeareth in a dream to Joseph in Egypt, saying, Arise, and take the young child and his mother, and go into the land of Israel: for <span class="highlight">they...</span>

                <p class="writing">
                    We, the citizens of America, are now joined in a great national effort to rebuild our country and to restore its promise for all of our people. Together, we will determine the course of America and the world for years to come. We will face challenges. We will confront hardships. But we will get the job done. Every four years, we gather on these steps to carry out the orderly and peaceful transfer of power, and we are grateful to President Obama and First Lady Michelle Obama for their gracious aid throughout this transition. They have been magnificent. Today’s 
                    <span class="highlight">ceremony,</span> however, has very special meaning. Because today we are not merely transferring power from one Administration to another, or from one party to another but we are transferring power from Washington, D.C. and giving it back to you, the American People. For too long, a small group in our nation’s Capital has reaped the rewards of government while the people have borne the cost. Washington flourished but the people did not share in its wealth. Politicians prospered but the jobs left, and the factories closed. The establishment protected itself, but not the citizens of our country. Their victories 
                    <span class="highlight">have</span> not been your victories; their triumphs have not been your triumphs; and while they celebrated in our nation’s Capital, there was little to celebrate for struggling families all across our land. That all changes starting right here, and right now, because this moment is your moment: it belongs to you. It belongs to everyone gathered here today and everyone watching all across America. This is your day. This is your celebration. And this, the United States of America, is your country. What truly matters is not which party controls our government, but whether our government is controlled by the 
                    <span class="highlight">people.</span> January 20th 2017, will be remembered as the day the people became the rulers of this nation again. The forgotten men and women of our country will be forgotten no longer. Everyone is listening to you now. You came by the tens of millions to become part of a historic movement the likes of which the world has never seen before. At the center of this movement is a crucial conviction: that a nation exists to serve its citizens. Americans want great schools for their children, safe neighborhoods for their families, and good jobs for themselves. These are the 
                    <span class="highlight">just</span> and reasonable demands of a righteous public. But for too many of our citizens, a different reality exists: Mothers and children trapped in poverty in our inner cities; rusted-out factories scattered like tombstones across the landscape of our nation; an education system, flush with cash, but which leaves our young and beautiful students deprived of knowledge; and the crime and gangs and drugs that have stolen too many lives and robbed our country of so much unrealized potential. This American carnage stops right here and stops right now. We are one nation and their pain is our pain. Their 
                    <span class="highlight">dreams</span> are our dreams; and their success will be our success. We share one heart, one home, and one glorious destiny. The oath of office I take today is an oath of allegiance to all Americans. For many decades, we’ve enriched foreign industry at the expense of American industry; Subsidized the armies of other countries while allowing for the very sad depletion of our military; We’ve defended other nation’s borders while refusing to defend our own; And spent trillions of dollars overseas while America’s infrastructure has fallen into disrepair and decay. We’ve made other countries rich while the wealth, strength, 
                    <span class="highlight">and</span> confidence of our country has disappeared over the horizon. One by one, the factories shuttered and left our shores, with not even a thought about the millions upon millions of American workers left behind. The wealth of our middle class has been ripped from their homes and then redistributed across the entire world. But that is the past. And now we are looking only to the future. We assembled here today are issuing a new decree to be heard in every city, in every foreign capital, and in every hall of power. From this day forward, a new vision <span class="highlight">will</span> govern our land. From this moment on, it’s going to be America First. Every decision on trade, on taxes, on immigration, on foreign affairs, will be made to benefit American workers and American families. We must protect our borders from the ravages of other countries making our products, stealing our companies, and destroying our jobs. Protection will lead to great prosperity and strength. I will fight for you with every breath in my body and I will never, ever let you down. America will start winning again, winning like never before. We will bring back our jobs. We will 
                    <span class="highlight">bring</span> back our borders. We will bring back our wealth. And we will bring back our dreams. We will build new roads, and highways, and bridges, and airports, and tunnels, and railways all across our wonderful nation. We will get our people off of welfare and back to work rebuilding our country with American hands and American labor. We will follow two simple rules: Buy American and Hire American. We will seek friendship and goodwill with the nations of the world but we do so with the understanding that it is the right of all nations to put their own 
                    <span class="highlight">interests</span> first. We do not seek to impose our way of life on anyone, but rather to let it shine as an example for everyone to follow. We will reinforce old alliances and form new ones and unite the civilized world against Radical Islamic Terrorism, which we will eradicate completely from the face of the Earth. At the bedrock of our politics will be a total allegiance to the United States of America, and through our loyalty to our country, we will rediscover our loyalty to each other. When you open your heart to patriotism, there is no room for 
                    <span class="highlight">prejudice.</span>
