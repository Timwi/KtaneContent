                <h2>On the Subject of Mistake Modules</h2>
                <p class="flavour-text">Somewhere deep inside, I know it may be wrong, but I'm ready to commit Mistake No. 2.</p>
                <p class="appendix-reference" id="appendix-reference">Use this manual's page 2 and page 3 or Appendix BLANK in <a href="Blind%20Alley.html#app-blank-modules">Blind Alley</a> for blank modules identification.</p>

                    <p>Our deepest apologies, but the bomb you were sent contains an unfinished module where the components were not added on schedule.
                    For that reason, we ask that you must destroy it. However, even though there are no components, the internal circuitry of the module is still present.</p>

                    <p>Since there are no components, the plastic of the module is very fragile, and can be destroyed simply by touching it.
                    However, the circuity is still active, and won't allow you to touch the module whenever you want.
                    Read below to learn what we suggest you do so you don’t get unintentional strikes on your bomb.</p>

                    <p style="margin-bottom: 3.5em;">We also understand that there are other functional modules that look identical to the one you were accidentally sent.
                    <em>Appendix NOT</em> contains information about how to differentiate this module from those modules.</p>

                    <h3>Disarming this module:</h3>

                    <p>You should be able to touch the module once without any problems.
                    If done correctly, you should hear the plastic shattering and the module should crack.</p>

                    <p>Be careful from now on, we don’t think that touching the module anytime is safe anymore.
                    We suggest that you touch it a second time when the last digit of the bomb's timer is equal to the last digit of the bomb's serial number.</p>

                    <p>Don’t worry, this is the last instruction we give you.
                    If our hypotheses are correct, you can touch the module again when the seconds section of the bomb's timer are equal to the sum of the digits of the bomb's serial number.
                    This should solve the module after a few seconds. If it doesn’t, please contact us.</p>

                    <p style="margin-bottom: 3em;">Should the module give a strike, the module will still shatter, and you should proceed to the next direction above.
                    The module may also solve even if it struck you shortly before. However, we don’t suggest that you keep touching it.</p>

                    <p style="margin-bottom: 1em;">Thank you for your cooperation. &nbsp; - The workers at the Bomb Factory</p>

                <h3 style="margin-bottom: 1em;">Differentiating this module from others:</h3>

                <p>Our reports of defusers encountering this module have led us to believe that it will only appear on the side of the bomb that contains the timer.</p>

                <strong>Hinges:</strong>
                <p>On a Hinges module, the status light is not initially visible and some of the hinges of the plastic are missing.
                The module you were sent has all the hinges in tact and the status light should always be visible.</p>

                <strong>The Octadecayotton:</strong>
                <p>When hovering over an Octadecayotton module, the bomb will start shaking and the module will make a loud noise, change color, and emit tiny particles*.
                The module you were sent will not do anything until it is touched.</p>

                <strong>Braille:</strong>
                <p>When hovering over a Braille module, you can feel dots in Braille. There are no dots on the module you were sent.</p>

                <strong>Polygons:</strong>
                <p>When hovering over a Polygons module, you can see the outlines of the hidden shapes. There are no hidden shapes on the module you were sent.</p>

                <strong>...? (Punctuation Marks):</strong>
                <p>When hovering over a Punctuation Marks module, the outline highlight of the module turns red-orange instead of yellow.
                Also, touching a Punctuation Marks module once is completely safe, as it doesn’t trigger any logical mechanisms within the module
                besides making a sound that's different to a shatter. The module you were sent will shatter upon being touched once.<p>

                <strong>Blind Alley:</strong>
                <p>When hovering over a Blind Alley module, you can hear the eight different sections of the module.
                The module you were sent only has one section. If you are unable to hear the differing sections,
                touching the status light of a Blind Alley module does nothing. On the module you were sent, pressing it will make the module shatter.</p>

                <p class="footnote">*We have no official evidence of that, it is simply what we believe.
                No known reports from defusers have confirmed what happens with an Octadecayotton module.
                We fear the worst.</p>

            <div class="page-content">

                <strong>Deaf Alley:</strong>
                <p>When hovering over a Deaf Alley module, you can hear the four different sections of the module as well as a bass tone in certain parts of the module.
                The module you were sent only has one section and cannot produce bass tones.
                If you are unable to hear the differing sections or the tone, touching a hinge on the plastic of a Deaf Alley module does nothing.
                On the module you were sent, pressing them will make the module shatter.</p>

                <strong>Tap Code:</strong>
                <p>Unfortunately, the module you were sent can’t be distinguished from a Tap Code module by hovering over parts of the module.
                However, when touching on a Tap Code module anywhere, it will either play a series of taps or record the taps you entered.
                Either way, the module will not appear to shatter, as the module you were sent does.
                This is also completely safe because the input for a Tap Code module can be reset at any time by holding the module.</p>

                <strong>42 and 501:</strong>
                <p>In a similar vain to Tap Code, the module you were sent can’t be distinguished from either a 42 or 501 module by hovering over parts of the module.
                However, touching the status light on a 42 or 501 module will not active its mechanism to display numbers.
                In addition, 42 and 501 modules will produce autotuned voice clips regularly.
                The module you were sent will shatter upon pressing the status light, and it cannot produce voice clips.</p>

                <strong>Eavesdropping:</strong>
                <p>When hovering over an Eavesdropping module, you can hear sounds similar to that of whirring, or similar to that of a printer.
                The module you were sent will not make any noise.</p>

                <strong>Finding The Invisible Cow:</strong>
                <p>When hovering over a Finding The Invisible Cow module, you can hear a voice repeatedly shout “COW”.
                The module you were sent will not make any noise.
                Speaking of which, I'm hoping nobody is trapped inside that bomb of yours...</p>
