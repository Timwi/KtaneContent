                    <p class="flavour-text">
                        This appears to be a strange interface for an old text
                        adventure game. All of the inventory management puzzles you
                        have come to know and love, but none of the story.

                    <ul>
                        <li>The three screens show the enemy you are
                            facing, a list of statistics about your
                            character and the world, and a list of the
                            objects in your inventory.
                        <li>In your inventory is three weapons, plus five miscellaneous
                            items.
                        <li>You must decide which of the items to use to prepare for the
                            battle, then which weapon to use.
                        <li>Use the left and right arrows to scroll through statistics and
                            inventory.
                        <li>To use an item or weapon, press “USE” when is is displayed in
                            the inventory.
                        <li>Use the item table below to determine whether or not to use each
                            item.
                        <li>Items can be used in any order, but all applicable items must be
                            used before a weapon is used to fight the enemy.
                        <li>Use the weapon table and the enemy statistic table to determine
                            which weapon to use to fight the enemy.
                        <li>For each weapon, compare the player’s relevant stat (STR, DEX,
                            or INT), plus any bonus, to the enemy’s same stat.
                        <li>To defeat the enemy most efficiently, use the weapon which has
                            the highest stat advantage (or lowest disadvantage).
                        <li>If two weapons have the same stat advantage, either can be used.
                    </ul>
