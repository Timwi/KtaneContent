                <h2>On the Subject of Lenticular Maze</h2>
                <p class="flavour-text">Side effects may include suffering from SRD (Severe Rotating Disease).</p>
                
                <p>The goal is to navigate through a 6x6 maze, picking up 3 purple squares along the way. The maze is made up of walls around each space, and are passable if the direction from your cell to the direction you want to go is white, and are not passable if black.</p>
                <p>At first, you may not be able to see the true color of each side of the wall, but rotating the bomb will allow the true color to shine. It is possible that you can travel to a cell, and not be able to go back to the previous cell from which you came from before.</p>
                <p>Collecting all 3 purple squares will solve the module. Hitting a wall at any point will give a strike.</p>
