                    <h2>On the Subject of Follow the Leader</h2>

                    <p class="flavour-text">Child’s play. Just follow the leader. Only if you fail to follow, the penalty is somewhat more explosive.

                    <p>This module contains 8-12 wires connecting numerically
                    labeled plugs in a looping sequence.  Each wire leads from one plug to the next
                    plug that contains a wire in ascending numerical order. A wire leading from plug 1 is considered to be “wire 1”.

                    <p>Progress through the module by first determining the
                    starting wire, then checking whether to cut each wire in the sequence.
                    Each wire will need to be either cut or left
                    uncut based on the state of the previous wire(s) in the sequence.

                    <h3>Determine Start Position</h3>

                    <p>Follow the first rule below that applies:

                    <ol>
                        <li>If <span class='rule' id='rule-port'>an RJ-45 port</span> is present and there is a wire
                            leading from <span class='rule' id='rule-plug-start'>plug 4</span> <em>directly</em> to <span class='rule' id='rule-plug-end'>plug 5</span>, begin at that wire.
                        <li>Otherwise, if there is a wire that begins at a plug
						    matching <span class='rule' id='rule-start-2'>the number of batteries on the bomb</span>, begin
						    with that wire.
                        <li>Otherwise, if there is a wire that begins at a plug
						    matching <span class='rule' id='rule-start-3'>the first numeral of the serial number</span>,
						    begin at that wire.
                        <li>Otherwise, if there is a <span class='rule' id='rule-indicator-lit'>lit</span> indicator with the
						    label <span class='rule' id='rule-indicator'>CLR</span>, disregard all further instructions and
						    cut all wires present on this module in descending
						    numerical order.
                        <li>If none of the above apply, the start position is
						    the plug containing a wire <span class='rule' id='rule-else'>earliest in numerical order</span>.
