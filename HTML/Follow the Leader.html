                    <h2>On the Subject of Follow the Leader</h2>

                    <p class="flavour-text">Child’s play. Just follow the leader. Only if you fail to follow, the penalty is somewhat more explosive.

                    <p>This module contains 8-12 wires connecting numerically
                    labeled plugs in a looping sequence.  Each wire leads from one plug to the next
                    plug that contains a wire in ascending numerical order. A wire leading from plug 1 is considered to be “wire 1”.

                    <p>Progress through the module by first determining the
                    starting wire, then checking whether to cut each wire in the sequence.
                    Each wire will need to be either cut or left
                    uncut based on the state of the previous wire(s) in the sequence.

                    <h3>Determine Start Position</h3>

                    <p>Follow the first rule below that applies:

                    <ol>
                        <li>If an RJ-45 port is present and there is a wire
                            leading from plug 4 <u>directly</u> to plug 5, begin at that wire.
                        <li>Otherwise, if there is a wire that begins at a plug
						    matching the number of batteries on the bomb, begin
						    with that wire.
                        <li>Otherwise, if there is a wire that begins at a plug
						    matching the first numeral of the serial number,
						    begin at that wire.
                        <li>Otherwise, if there is a lit indicator with the
						    label CLR, disregard all further instructions and
						    cut all wires present on this module in descending
						    numerical order.
                        <li>If none of the above apply, the start position is
						    the plug containing a wire earliest in numerical order.
                    </ol>

                    <h3>Cutting Wires</h3>
                    <ul>
                        <li><u>Always</u> cut the wire at the starting plug.
						    Then progress to the next wire.
                        <li>From this position, cut the wires as directed by
						    the steps in the following table.  The starting
						    step corresponds to the first letter in the serial
						    number. If the serial number contains no letters,
						    begin at step A.
                        <li>When progressing to the next wire, also progress to
						    the next step alphabetically in the table to determine
						    whether to cut the wire.
                        <li>"Previous wire(s)" may refer to wires beyond the
						    original starting position in the sequence.
                        <li>If the wire at the starting plug is red, green, or
						    white, progress through the steps in reverse
						    alphabetical order instead.
                    </ul>
