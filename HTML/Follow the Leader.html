                <h2>On the Subject of Follow the Leader</h2>

                <p class="flavour-text">Child’s play. Just follow the leader. Only if you fail to follow, the penalty is somewhat more explosive.
                <p>This module contains 8-12 wires connecting numerically labeled plugs in a loop.  Each wire leads from one plug to another plug in clockwise order. In this manual, wires are numbered according to the plug they lead from; a wire from plug 1 to plug 2 is considered to be “wire 1”, while a wire from plug 12 to plug 1 is considered to be “wire 12”.</p>
                <p> Progress through the module by first cutting the starting wire, then cutting each applicable wire in the order of the sequence. Each wire will need to be either cut or left uncut based on the state of the previous wire(s) in the sequence. Avoid cutting wires out of sequence.</p>

                <h3>Determining the starting wire</h3>
                <p>Follow the first rule below that applies:</p>

                <ol>
                    <li>If <span class='rule' id='rule-port'>an RJ-45 port</span> is present and there is a wire leading from <span class='rule' id='rule-plug-start'>plug 4</span> <em>directly</em> to <span class='rule' id='rule-plug-end'>plug 5</span>, begin at that wire.</li>
                    <li>Otherwise, if there is a wire that begins at a plug matching <span class='rule' id='rule-start-2'>the number of batteries on the bomb</span>, begin with that wire.</li>
                    <li>Otherwise, if there is a wire that begins at a plug matching <span class='rule' id='rule-start-3'>the first numeral of the serial number</span>, begin at that wire.</li>
                    <li>Otherwise, if there is a <span class='rule' id='rule-indicator-lit'>lit</span> indicator with the label <span class='rule' id='rule-indicator'>CLR</span>, disregard all further instructions and cut all wires present on this module in descending numerical order.</li>
                    <li>If none of the above apply, the starting wire is the wire <span class='rule' id='rule-else'>earliest in numerical order</span>.</li>

                    <li>“Previous wire(s)” may refer to wires beyond the original starting position in the sequence.</li>
