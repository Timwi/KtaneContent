                <h2>On the Subject of Button Grids</h2>
                <p class="flavour-text">“This isn’t as hard as it looks...”</p>
                <ul>
                    <li>This module consists of a 4×5 grid of buttons with the colors red, blue, yellow, and green as well as five LEDs at the top of the module and a reset button.</li>
                    <li>Each color should occur exactly five times.</li>
                    <li>To disarm the module, press each button once across five stages.</li>
                    <li>The module has five stages with the current stage being indicated by the number of lit LEDs on the top.</li>
                    <li>For each of the five stages, press exactly one of each color button in a certain order. If the buttons are pressed in an incorrect order, a strike will be issued at the end of the stage.</li>
                    <li><strong>Do not press the same button more than once. Buttons will not change state once they have been pressed.</strong> A strike will instantly be issued once a button that has already been pressed is pressed again, and the input for the current stage will reset.</li>
                    <li>If there is a lit BOB indicator, a DVI-D port, exactly one battery, and at least one letter in the serial number in common with the word CHRIS, then press four buttons in the order of Blue, Red, Blue, Yellow to instantly solve the module. This can only be done in Stage 1, and two different blue buttons must be pressed.</li>
                </ul>

                <h3>Stage 1</h3>
                <ol>
                    <li>If the four corners are all different colors, stage 1’s order is Red, Blue, Yellow, Green.</li>
                    <li>Otherwise, if any column on the module contains all four colors, stage 1’s order is Green, Red, Yellow, Blue.</li>
                    <li>Otherwise, if a row on the module is missing a color entirely, stage 1’s order is Red, Yellow, Blue, Green.</li>
                    <li>Otherwise, stage 1’s order is Green, Yellow, Blue, Red.</li>
