                <h2>On the Subject of Button Grids</h2>
                <p class="flavour-text">“This isn’t as hard as it looks...”</p>
                <ul>
                    <li>This module consists of an 8×5 grid of buttons with the color red, blue, yellow, and green as well as ten LEDs at the top of the module and a reset button. To defuse this module, you have to press each button once.
                    <li>Each color should occur exactly ten times.
                    <li><strong>NOTE: You cannot press the same button more than once. Buttons will not change state once they have been pressed. If you press a button you have already pressed, you will instantly get a strike, and the current stage you are on will reset.</strong>
                    <li>This module consists of ten stages with the current stage you’re on being indicated by the lit LED on the top (buttons are numbered in reading order).
                    <li>For each stage, you must press exactly one of each color button in a certain order.
                    <li>If you press the buttons in the wrong color order, you will get a strike at the end of the stage.
                    <li>Follow the instructions from top to bottom.
                </ul>

                <p><strong>HOWEVER</strong>, if you have a lit BOB indicator, a DVI-D port, exactly one battery, and at least one letter in the serial number in common with the word "CHRIS", then you can press the colors <strong>BLUE, RED, BLUE, YELLOW</strong> to instantly solve the module. However, this must be done in Stage 1.</p>
