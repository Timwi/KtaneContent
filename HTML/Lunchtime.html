                <h2>On the Subject of Lunchtime</h2>
                <p class="flavour-text">Your boss has tasked you with buying his lunch. He’s given you some money and shoved you out the door, and… what’s that in the bag he gave you? A bomb? Oh, come on.</p>

                <p>Buy your boss something he likes for lunch, or he’ll blow you up. If only he wasn’t such a picky eater… </p>

                <p>The amount of money given to you is (randomly generated) shown via a sticker on the module. Your job is to buy the highest-priced meal for your boss that he likes without going over your budget. He may also want you back by a certain time.</p>

                <p>Follow these rules in order to know if you have any spare change with you to add to your boss’s budget (expert).</p>
                <ul>
                    <li>If there are more than 4 batteries, add $0.61</li>
                    <li>Otherwise If there is a lit FRK indicator and no parallel ports, add $0.43</li>
                    <li>Otherwise If there are more than 2 different types of ports, add $0.18</li>
                    <li>Otherwise If there are both FRQ and CAR indicators (lit or unlit), subtract $1.00</li>
                    <li>Otherwise If the bomb’s serial number contains a vowel, add $0.37</li>
                    <li>Otherwise If none of these apply, do not change the amount of money.</li>
                </ul>

                <p>The number of batteries determine what categories your boss likes and doesn’t like.</p>
                <ul>
                    <li>AA>D = likes sandwiches, not entree plates.</li>
                    <li>D>AA = likes entree plates, not sandwiches.</li>
                    <li>AA=D likes both entree plates and sandwiches.</li>
                    <li>All food in the “Other” category is assumed to be liked until stated otherwise.</li>
                </ul>

                <h3>What Foods Your Boss Likes</h3>
                <ul>
                    <li>If there is at least one of a lit SND or CLR, or unlit MSA or BOB, your boss does not like vegetables and will not eat foods marked with a V.</li>
                    <li>Otherwise If the total number of indicators and ports adds up to 5 or more, your boss has a dairy allergy and cannot eat foods marked with a D.</li>
                    <li>Otherwise If your budget is over $6.00 and there are less than 2 batteries, your boss doesn’t like any foods with 2 vowels in a row.</li>
                </ul>
