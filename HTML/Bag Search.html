                <h2>On the Subject of Bag Searches</h2>
                <p class="flavour-text">Remember, folks, in the world of baggage search, it's 'dangerous luggage' we're defusing, not 'the B-word.' Let's keep it calm and safe!</p>
                
                <p>Search the bags of 3 passengers and either detain them or allow them to board the plane by following the steps below to disarm this module.</p>

                <h3>Basic Rules:</h3>
                <p>For each passenger follow these steps, breach of the rules will cause a strike:</p>
                <ul>
                    <li>Check the airline information on the next page which corresponds to the current passenger's flight.
                        <ul>
                            <li>If the airline does not exist, do not X-ray the bag and instantly detain the passenger.</li>
                        </ul>
                    </li>
                    <li>Press the X-ray button to enable the state of the art X-ray scanner device.</li>
                    <li>
                        Examine the items inside the bag, following the items specific rules on page 3.
                        <ul>
                            <li>Click on any items to confiscate them.</li>
                            <li>Remember to always confiscate any items which are banned by the airline.</li>
                            <li>Confiscated items' rules still apply e.g. if a passenger has a confiscated passport, they still count as having a passport.</li>
                        </ul>
                    </li>
                    <li>
                        Turn the X-ray machine off again by pressing the X-ray button.
                        <ul>
                            <li>Do not do this until all items which should be confiscated have been.</li>
                        </ul>
                    </li>
                    <li>
                        Press either the handcuffs or the plane icons to detain the passenger or allow them to board the plane respectively.
                        <ul>
                            <li>By default passengers are allowed to board unless there is a reason why they should be detained instead.</li>
                            <li>Doing this will cause the next passenger to arrive.</li>
                            <li>After 3 passengers your shift is complete and the module will be disarmed.</li>
                        </ul>
