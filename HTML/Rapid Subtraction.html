                <h2>On the Subject of Rapid Subtraction</h2>
                <p class="flavour-text">I remember Brain Age. This one minigame from there didn’t look like that.</p>
                <p>This module presents a keypad of 10 digit, clear and submit buttons (labeled as C and S respectively), a progress bar, and 2 number displays. When the module activates, the module will display the starting value on the big display, mostly within the 90s.</p>
                <p>Inputting the incorrect value or running out of time will cause a strike and reset the streak. Inputting the correct value otherwise will add 5 seconds onto the needy timer. You then must use the correct value as the current value; unless the correct value inputted before is a single digit, the needy will deactivate and increase the streak counter by 1 instead. Upon entering the correct value, at least one of the digits on the display will glitch out until the needy is deactivated.</p>
                <p>The clear button can be used to reshow the current value at a cost of 5 seconds on the needy if there is no input currently for the next value to submit. This cannot activate if the needy timer has fewer than 5 seconds left.</p>
                <p>The value that needs to be subtracted by is determined by the streak you are on with this needy as well as the edgework around the casing. A progress bar underneath the input digit display will show the streak the defuser is on. The more of the progress bar is filled, the less frequent the needy will activate.</p>
                <p>Use the first rule from the table provided for each streak, starting from the top in each column.</p>
