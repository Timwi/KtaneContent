                <ul>
                    <li>The module has five colored switches and 10 LEDs beneath them. If the switches aren’t colored or there are lit LEDs other than the upper left one, you’re looking at a different module. </li>
                    <li>Each switch can be orange, green, purple, turquoise, blue, or red. The first LED in reading order is one of the colors mentioned above or white, all the other LEDs are unlit.</li>
                    <li>To disarm the module, based on the LEDs, flip a switch each stage for 10 consecutive stages.</li>
                    <li>After a switch is flipped, the next LED in reading order will light up and another input will be requested.</li>
                    <li>If the incorrect switch for a stage is flipped, a strike will be incurred and the switch will not flip.</li>
                    <li>Follow the rules below for each LED.</li>
                </ul>
                <p><strong>NOTE:</strong> “not present =” means “If the aforementioned switch is not present…”</p>
