                    Two households, both alike in dignity, In fair Verona, <b>where</b> we lay our scene, From ancient grudge break to <b>new</b> mutiny, Where civil blood makes civil hands unclean. From <b>forth</b> the fatal loins of these two foes A pair <b>of</b> star-cross’d lovers take their life; Whose misadventured piteous overthrows <b>Do</b> with their death bury their parents’ strife. The fearful <b>passage</b> of their death-mark’d love, And the continuance of their <b>parents’</b> rage, Which, but their children’s end, nought could remove, <b>Is</b> now the two hours’ traffic of our stage; The <b>which</b> if you with patient ears attend, What here shall 
                    <em>MISS,</em> our toil shall strive to mend. Gregory, o’ my <b>word,</b> we’ll not carry coals. No, for then we should <b>be</b> colliers. I mean, an we be in choler, we’ll <b>draw.</b> Ay, while you live, draw your neck out o’ <b>the</b> collar. I strike quickly, being moved. But thou art <b>not</b> quickly moved to strike. A dog of the house <b>of</b> Montague moves me. To move is to stir; and <b>to</b> be valiant is to stand: therefore, if thou art <b>moved,</b> thou runn’st away. A dog of that house shall <b>move</b> me to stand: I will take the wall of 
                    <em>ANY</em> man or maid of Montague’s. That shows thee a <b>weak</b> slave; for the weakest goes to the wall. True; <b>and</b> therefore women, being the weaker vessels, are ever thrust <b>to</b> the wall: therefore I will push Montague’s men from <b>the</b> wall, and thrust his maids to the wall. The <b>quarrel</b> is between our masters and us their men. ‘Tis <b>all</b> one, I will show myself a tyrant: when I <b>have</b> fought with the men, I will be cruel with <b>the</b> maids, and cut off their heads. The heads of <b>the</b> maids? Ay, the heads of the maids, or their 
                    <em>MAIDENHEADS;</em> take it in what sense thou wilt. They must <b>take</b> it in sense that feel it. Me they shall <b>feel</b> while I am able to stand: and ‘tis known <b>I</b> am a pretty piece of flesh. ‘Tis well thou <b>art</b> not fish; if thou hadst, thou hadst been poor <b>John.</b> Draw thy tool! here comes two of the house <b>of</b> the Montagues. My naked weapon is out: quarrel, I <b>will</b> back thee. How! turn thy back and run? Fear <b>me</b> not. No, marry; I fear thee! Let us take <b>the</b> law of our sides; let them begin. I will 
                    <em>FROWN</em> as I pass by, and let them take it <b>as</b> they list. Nay, as they dare. I will bite <b>my</b> thumb at them; which is a disgrace to them, <b>if</b> they bear it. Do you bite your thumb at <b>us,</b> sir? I do bite my thumb, sir. Do you <b>bite</b> your thumb at us, sir? Is the law of <b>our</b> side, if I say ay? No. No, sir, I <b>do</b> not bite my thumb at you, sir, but I <b>bite</b> my thumb, sir. Do you quarrel, sir? Quarrel sir! <b>no,</b> sir. If you do, sir, I am for you: 
                    <em>I</em> serve as good a man as you. No better. <b>Well,</b> sir. Say ‘better:’ here comes one of my master’s <b>kinsmen.</b> Yes, better, sir. You lie. Draw, if you be <b>men.</b> Gregory, remember thy swashing blow. Part, fools! Put up <b>your</b> swords; you know not what you do. What, art <b>thou</b> drawn among these heartless hinds? Turn thee, Benvolio, look <b>upon</b> thy death. I do but keep the peace: put <b>up</b> thy sword, Or manage it to part these men <b>with</b> me. What, drawn, and talk of peace! I hate <b>the</b> word, As I hate hell, all Montagues, and thee: 
                    <em>HAVE</em> at thee, coward! Clubs, bills, and partisans! strike! beat <b>them</b> down! Down with the Capulets! down with the Montagues! <b>What</b> noise is this? Give me my long sword, ho! <b>A</b> crutch, a crutch! why call you for a sword? <b>My</b> sword, I say! Old Montague is come, And flourishes <b>his</b> blade in spite of me. Thou villain Capulet, Hold <b>me</b> not, let me go. Thou shalt not stir a <b>foot</b> to seek a foe. Rebellious subjects, enemies to peace, <b>Profaners</b> of this neighbour-stained steel, Will they not hear? What, <b>ho!</b> you men, you beasts, That quench the fire of 
                    <em>YOUR</em> pernicious rage With purple fountains issuing from your veins, <b>On</b> pain of torture, from those bloody hands Throw your <b>mistemper’d</b> weapons to the ground, And hear the sentence of <b>your</b> moved prince. Three civil brawls, bred of an airy <b>word,</b> By thee, old Capulet, and Montague, Have thrice disturb’d <b>the</b> quiet of our streets, And made Verona’s ancient citizens <b>Cast</b> by their grave beseeming ornaments, To wield old partisans, <b>in</b> hands as old, Canker’d with peace, to part your <b>canker’d</b> hate: If ever you disturb our streets again, Your <b>lives</b> shall pay the forfeit of the peace. For this 
                    <em>TIME,</em> all the rest depart away: You Capulet; shall go <b>along</b> with me: And, Montague, come you this afternoon, To <b>know</b> our further pleasure in this case, To old Free-town, <b>our</b> common judgment-place. Once more, on pain of death, all <b>men</b> depart. Who set this ancient quarrel new abroach? Speak, <b>nephew,</b> were you by when it began? Here were the <b>servants</b> of your adversary, And yours, close fighting ere I <b>did</b> approach: I drew to part them: in the instant <b>came</b> The fiery Tybalt, with his sword prepared, Which, as <b>he</b> breathed defiance to my ears, He swung about his 
                    <em>HEAD</em> and cut the winds, Who nothing hurt withal hiss’d <b>him</b> in scorn: While we were interchanging thrusts and blows, <b>Came</b> more and more and fought on part and part, <b>Till</b> the prince came, who parted either part. O, where <b>is</b> Romeo? saw you him to-day? Right glad I am <b>he</b> was not at this fray. Madam, an hour before <b>the</b> worshipp’d sun Peer’d forth the golden window of the <b>east,</b> A troubled mind drave me to walk abroad; Where, <b>underneath</b> the grove of sycamore That westward rooteth from the <b>city’s</b> side, So early walking did I see your son:

                    According to all known laws of aviation, there is <b>no</b> way a bee should be able to fly. Its <b>wings</b> are too small to get its fat little body <b>off</b> the ground. The bee, of course, flies anyway because <b>bees</b> don’t care what humans think is impossible. Yellow, black. <b>Yellow,</b> black. Yellow, black. Yellow, black. Ooh, black and yellow! <b>Let’s</b> shake it up a little. Barry! Breakfast is ready! <b>Coming!</b> Hang on a second. Hello? Barry? Adam? Can you <b>believe</b> this is happening? I can’t. I’ll pick you up. <b>Looking</b> sharp. Use the stairs. Your father paid good money 
                    <em>FOR</em> those. Sorry. I’m excited. Here’s the graduate. We’re very <b>proud</b> of you, son. A perfect report card, all B’s. <b>Very</b> proud. Ma! I got a thing going here. You <b>got</b> lint on your fuzz. Ow! That’s me! Wave to <b>us!</b> We’ll be in row 118,000. Bye! Barry, I told <b>you,</b> stop flying in the house! Hey, Adam. Hey, Barry. <b>Is</b> that fuzz gel? A little. Special day, graduation. Never <b>thought</b> I’d make it. Three days grade school, three days <b>high</b> school. Those were awkward. Three days college. I’m glad <b>I</b> took a day and hitchhiked around the hive. You 
                    <em>DID</em> come back different. Hi, Barry. Artie, growing a mustache? <b>Looks</b> good. Hear about Frankie? Yeah. You going to the <b>funeral?</b> No, I’m not going. Everybody knows, sting someone, you <b>die.</b> Don’t waste it on a squirrel. Such a hothead. <b>I</b> guess he could have just gotten out of the <b>way.</b> I love this incorporating an amusement park into our <b>day.</b> That’s why we don’t need vacations. Boy, quite a <b>bit</b> of pomp under the circumstances. Well, Adam, today we <b>are</b> men. We are! Bee men. Amen! Hallelujah! Students, faculty, <b>distinguished</b> bees, please welcome Dean Buzzwell. Welcome, New Hive City 
                    <em>GRADUATING</em> class of 9:15. That concludes our ceremonies. And begins <b>your</b> career at Honex Industries! Will we pick our job <b>today?</b> I heard it’s just orientation. Heads up! Here we <b>go.</b> Keep your hands and antennas inside the tram at <b>all</b> times. Wonder what it’ll be like? A little scary. <b>Welcome</b> to Honex, a division of Honesco and a part <b>of</b> the Hexagon Group. This is it! Wow. Wow. We <b>know</b> that you, as a bee, have worked your whole <b>life</b> to get to the point where you can work <b>for</b> your whole life. Honey begins when our valiant Pollen 
                    <em>JOCKS</em> bring the nectar to the hive. Our top secret <b>formula</b> is automatically color corrected, scent adjusted and bubble contoured <b>into</b> this soothing sweet syrup with its distinctive golden glow <b>you</b> know as Honey! That girl was hot. She’s my <b>cousin!</b> She is? Yes, we’re all cousins. Right. You’re right. <b>At</b> Honex, we constantly strive to improve every aspect of <b>bee</b> existence. These bees are stress testing a new helmet <b>technology.</b> What do you think he makes? Not enough. Here <b>we</b> have our latest advancement, the Krelman. What does that <b>do?</b> Catches that little strand of honey that hangs after 
                    <em>YOU</em> pour it. Saves us millions. Can anyone work on <b>the</b> Krelman? Of course. Most bee jobs are small ones. <b>But</b> bees know that every small job, if it’s done <b>well,</b> means a lot. But choose carefully because you’ll stay <b>in</b> the job you pick for the rest of your <b>life.</b> The same job the rest of your life? I <b>didn’t</b> know that. What’s the difference? You’ll be happy to <b>know</b> that bees, as a species, haven’t had one day <b>off</b> in 27 million years. So you’ll just work us <b>to</b> death? We’ll sure try. Wow! That blew my mind! 
                    <em>WHAT’S</em> the difference? How can you say that? One job <b>forever?</b> That’s an insane choice to have to make. I’m <b>relieved.</b> Now we only have to make one decision in <b>life.</b> But, Adam, how could they never have told us <b>that?</b> Why would you question anything? We’re bees. We’re the <b>most</b> perfectly functioning society on Earth. You ever think maybe <b>things</b> work a little too well here? Like what? Give <b>me</b> one example. I don’t know. But you know what <b>I’m</b> talking about. Please clear the gate. Royal Nectar Force <b>on</b> approach. Wait a second. Check it out. Hey, those 
                    <em>ARE</em> Pollen Jocks! Wow. I’ve never seen them this close. <b>They</b> know what it’s like outside the hive. Yeah, but <b>some</b> don’t come back. Hey, Jocks! Hi, Jocks! You guys <b>did</b> great! You’re monsters! You’re sky freaks! I love it! <b>I</b> love it! I wonder where they were. I don’t <b>know.</b> Their day’s not planned. Outside the hive, flying who <b>knows</b> where, doing who knows what. You can’t just decide <b>to</b> be a Pollen Jock. You have to be bred <b>for</b> that. Right. Look. That’s more pollen than you and <b>I</b> will see in a lifetime. It’s just a status 
                    <em>SYMBOL.</em> Bees make too much of it. Perhaps. Unless you’re <b>wearing</b> it and the ladies see you wearing it. Those <b>ladies?</b> Aren’t they our cousins too? Distant. Distant. Look at <b>these</b> two. Couple of Hive Harrys. Let’s have fun with <b>them.</b> It must be dangerous being a Pollen Jock. Yeah. <b>Once</b> a bear pinned me against a mushroom! He had <b>a</b> paw on my throat, and with the other, he <b>was</b> slapping me! Oh, my! I never thought I’d knock <b>him</b> out. What were you doing during this? Trying to <b>alert</b> the authorities. I can autograph that. A little gusty 
                    <em>OUT</em> there today, wasn’t it, comrades? Yeah. Gusty. We’re hitting <b>a</b> sunflower patch six miles from here tomorrow. Six miles, <b>huh?</b> Barry! A puddle jump for us, but maybe you’re <b>not</b> up for it. Maybe I am. You are not! <b>We’re</b> going 0900 at J Gate. What do you think, <b>buzzy</b> boy? Are you bee enough? I might be. It <b>all</b> depends on what 0900 means. Hey, Honex! Dad, you <b>surprised</b> me. You decide what you’re interested in? Well, there’s <b>a</b> lot of choices. But you only get one. Do <b>you</b> ever get bored doing the same job every day?

And we <b>decided</b> that one big pile was better than Two little <b>piles,</b> and rather than bring that one up, we decided <b>to</b> throw Ours down. That’s what we did Drove back <b>to</b> the church, had a Thanksgiving dinner that couldn’t be <b>beat,</b> Went to sleep, and didn’t get up until the <b>next</b> morning, when we got a phone Call from Officer 
                    <em>OBIE.</em> He said, “kid, we found your name on a <b>envelope</b> at The bottom of a half a ton of <b>garbage</b> and I just wanted to know if you had <b>Any</b> information about it” And I said, “yes sir, Officer <b>Obie,</b> I cannot tell a lie. I put that envelope <b>Under</b> that garbage.” After speaking to Obie for about forty <b>five</b> minutes on The telephone, we finally arrived at the <b>truth</b> of the matter and he said That we had <b>to</b> go down and pick up the garbage, and also <b>had</b> to go down and Speak to him at the 
                    <em>POLICE</em> Officer Station. So we got in the red VW <b>microbus</b> With the shovels and rakes and implements of destruction <b>and</b> headed on Toward the Police Officer Station Now, friends, <b>there</b> was only one of two things that Obie could’ve <b>done</b> at The Police Officer Station, and the first was <b>that</b> he could’ve given us a Medal for being so <b>brave</b> and honest on the telephone (which wasn’t very Likely, <b>and</b> we didn’t expect it), and the other thing was <b>that</b> he could’ve Bawled us out and told us never <b>to</b> be seen drivin’ garbage around in the Vicinity again, 
                    <em>WHICH</em> is what we expected But when we got to <b>the</b> Police Officer Station, there was a third possibility That <b>we</b> hadn’t even counted upon, and we was both immediately <b>arrested,</b> Handcuffed, and I said, “Obie, I can’t pick up <b>the</b> garbage with these here Handcuffs on.” He said “shut <b>up</b> kid, and get in the back of the patrol <b>car”</b> And that’s what we did, sat in the back <b>of</b> the patrol car, and drove to The quote scene <b>of</b> the crime unquote I want to tell you ‘bout <b>the</b> town of Stockbridge, Massachusetts, where this is Happening’. They 
                    <em>GOT</em> three stop signs, two police officers, and one police <b>Car,</b> but when we got to the scene of the <b>crime,</b> there was five police officers and three police cars, <b>bein’</b> the biggest crime of the last fifty Years and <b>everybody</b> wanted to get in the newspaper story about it <b>And</b> they was using up all kinds of cop equipment <b>that</b> they had hangin’ Around the Police Officer Station. They <b>was</b> takin’ plaster tire tracks, Footprints, dog smelling’ prints and <b>they</b> took twenty seven 8x10 colored Glossy photographs with circles <b>and</b> arrows and a paragraph on the back of Each 
                    <em>ONE</em> explaining’ what each one was, to be used as <b>evidence</b> against us Took pictures of the approach, the getaway, <b>the</b> northwest corner, the Southwest corner And that’s not to <b>mention</b> the aerial photography! After the ordeal, we went back <b>to</b> the jail. Obie said he was gonna put us <b>in</b> a cell He said “kid, I’m gonna put you <b>in</b> a cell I want your wallet and your belt” <b>I</b> said, “Obie, I can understand your wantin’ my wallet, <b>so</b> I don’t have any Money to spend in the <b>cell,</b> but what do you want my belt for?” and 
                    <em>HE</em> said “Kid, we don’t want any hangin’s I said, <b>“Obie,</b> did you think I was gonna Hang myself for <b>litterin’?”</b> Obie said he was making sure, and, friends, Obie <b>was,</b> ‘cause he took out the Toilet seat so I <b>couldn’t</b> hit myself over the head and drown, and he <b>took</b> Out the toilet paper so I couldn’t bend the <b>bars,</b> roll the toilet paper out The window, slide down <b>the</b> roll and have an escape.

                    This module consists of a screen, eight dials with <b>red</b> labels, and a QWERTY keyboard. The labels on the <b>dials,</b> when decrypted and read from left to right, spell <b>out</b> an eight letter word. The word has been encrypted <b>through</b> a series of ciphers, indicated by the direction each <b>dial</b> is pointing, from left to right. Once deciphered, find <b>the</b> word in the table below, the word written below <b>it</b> is the word that should be entered. Apply the <b>same</b> sequence of encryptions to the response word, and type <b>out</b> the encrypted response word using the keys. The word 
                    <em>IS</em> automatically submitted when eight keys are pressed. The red <b>button</b> can be pressed at any time before the eighth <b>key</b> is pressed to cancel the input. Inputting any of <b>the</b> eight letters incorrectly will cause a strike to be <b>issued</b> and reset the module. Note: Unless stated otherwise, any <b>reference</b> to a letter’s alphabetic position starts at A equals <b>1.</b> Similarly, any reference to the position of a dial <b>starts</b> from the leftmost dial equals 1. For each dial: <b>if</b> the number of 45 degree rotations, starting from north, <b>is</b> odd, then the bit given by the dial is 
                    <em>1.</em> Otherwise, it is 0. Form four pairs of bits <b>by</b> grouping the bits corresponding to adjacent pairs of dials <b>from</b> left to right. Form another four pair of bits <b>by</b> grouping the bits corresponding to adjacent pairs of dials <b>in</b> reading order. Each of the eight pairs of bits <b>correspond</b> to each of the eight dials from left to <b>right.</b> Using the operator corresponding to the position of the <b>north</b> pointing dial, find the truth values of each pair; <b>the</b> encrypted letter depends on whether each is true or <b>false.</b> Each letter in the word is swapped with the 
                    <em>LETTER</em> with the same alphabetic position in the reversed alphabet. <b>That</b> is, a letter with alphabetic position X will become <b>the</b> letter with alphabetic position 27 minus X. If the <b>LED</b> below the north pointing dial is lit, the Atbash <b>cipher</b> is applied to the input of the Logic cipher. <b>Otherwise,</b> the Atbash cipher is applied to the output of <b>the</b> Logic cipher. Each letter in the word has been <b>shifted</b> forwards through the alphabet by the number of 45 <b>degree</b> clockwise rotations, starting from north, to the direction its <b>corresponding</b> dial is pointing. If the LED corresponding to this 
                    <em>DIAL</em> is lit, each letter is then shifted further by <b>the</b> position of the dial corresponding to this cipher. Otherwise, <b>each</b> letter is then shifted backwards through the alphabet by <b>the</b> position of the dial corresponding to this cipher. The <b>indexing</b> of the lists start at zero. If the last <b>dial</b> is pointing east, use the word corresponding to the <b>number</b> of 45 degree rotations, starting from north, of the <b>first</b> dial. Otherwise, the number of 45 degree rotations, starting <b>from</b> north, of the next dial corresponds to which of <b>the</b> words in the lists below is the keyword for 
                    <em>THIS</em> cipher. If there are less than three unique ports <b>on</b> the bomb, use the keyword from List A. Otherwise, <b>use</b> the keyword from List B. The keyword gives the <b>first</b> ten letters or top two rows of the keysquare. <b>If</b> the LED corresponding to this cipher is unlit, the <b>keyword</b> is entered into the keysquare in reading order. Otherwise, <b>the</b> keyword is entered into the keysquare in reverse reading <b>order.</b> The remaining 15 letters fill the rest of the <b>keysquare</b> in alphabetical order, excluding X, which is never used. <b>The</b> word is split into four pairs of letters. Each 
                    <em>PAIR</em> of letters is altered: If both letters are the <b>same,</b> the encrypted pair is two of the letter diametrically <b>opposite</b> in the keysquare. Otherwise, if both letters belong to <b>the</b> same row of the keysquare, shift both letters one <b>space</b> to the right along the row. Otherwise, if both <b>letters</b> belong to the same column of the keysquare, shift <b>both</b> letters once space down the column. Otherwise, the letters <b>lie</b> on diagonally opposite corners of a rectangle, the encrypted <b>pair</b> consists of the letters in the horizontally opposite corners <b>from</b> the original pair. If the pair of letters is 
                    <em>XX,</em> the pair is unchanged by the cipher. If the <b>pair</b> of letters is either XY or YX, where Y <b>is</b> not X, the X is changed to the other <b>letter,</b> forming a double letter pair, and enciphered normally. Then, <b>the</b> new letter is changed back to an X. Each <b>letter</b> is translated using one of the two pigpen ciphers <b>below.</b> Starting from north, the pigpen characters are rotated to <b>face</b> the direction the dial is pointing. The rotated pigpen <b>characters</b> are then translated back, as though they are still <b>facing</b> north, to produce the encrypted letter. If the LED 
                    <em>CORRESPONDING</em> to this cipher is unlit, use cipher I. Otherwise, <b>use</b> cipher II. The indexing of the lists start at <b>0.</b> For this cipher, the leftmost dial has a position <b>of</b> 0. The two lists give the keywords for two <b>5x5</b> keysquares, the keyword from List A is used for <b>the</b> first keysquare and the keyword from List B is <b>used</b> for the second: If the numbers in the serial <b>number</b> add up to more than 9, the keyword in <b>List</b> A is given by the position of dial and <b>the</b> keyword in List B is given by the number 
                    <em>OF</em> 45 degree rotations, starting from north, of the previous <b>dial.</b> Otherwise, the keyword in List B is given by <b>the</b> position of dial and the keyword in List A <b>is</b> given by the number of 45 degree rotations, starting <b>from</b> north, of the previous dial. If the first dial <b>is</b> pointing south, the ‘previous’ dial is the last dial. <b>These</b> keywords are used to construct two cipher alphabets where <b>each</b> keyword precedes the remaining sixteen letters. For each letter, <b>from</b> left to right, consider the status of the LED <b>below</b> the dial in its position: If the status of

                    In the beginning God created the heaven and the <b>earth.</b> And the earth was without form, and void; and <b>darkness</b> was upon the face of the deep. And the <b>Spirit</b> of God moved upon the face of the waters. <b>And</b> God said, Let there be light and there was <b>light.</b> And God saw the light, that it was good <b>and</b> God divided the light from the darkness. And God <b>called</b> the light Day, and the darkness he called Night. <b>And</b> the evening and the morning were the first day. <b>And</b> God said, Let there be a firmament in the 
                    <em>MIDST</em> of the waters, and let it divide the waters <b>from</b> the waters. And God made the firmament, and divided <b>the</b> waters which were under the firmament from the waters <b>which</b> were above the firmament and it was so. And <b>God</b> called the firmament Heaven. And the evening and the <b>morning</b> were the second day. And God said, Let the <b>waters</b> under the heaven be gathered together unto one place, <b>and</b> let the dry land appear and it was so. <b>And</b> God called the dry land Earth; and the gathering <b>together</b> of the waters called he Seas and God saw 
                    <em>THAT</em> it was good. And God said, Let the earth <b>bring</b> forth grass, the herb yielding seed, and the fruit <b>tree</b> yielding fruit after his kind, whose seed is in <b>itself,</b> upon the earth and it was so. And the <b>earth</b> brought forth grass, and herb yielding seed after his <b>kind,</b> and the tree yielding fruit, whose seed was in <b>itself,</b> after his kind: and God saw that it was <b>good.</b> And the evening and the morning were the third <b>day.</b> And God said, Let there be lights in the <b>firmament</b> of the heaven to divide the day from the 
                    <em>NIGHT;</em> and let them be for signs, and for seasons, <b>and</b> for days, and years and let them be for <b>lights</b> in the firmament of the heaven to give light <b>upon</b> the earth and it was so. And God made <b>two</b> great lights; the greater light to rule the day, <b>and</b> the lesser light to rule the night he made <b>the</b> stars also. And God set them in the firmament <b>of</b> the heaven to give light upon the earth, and <b>to</b> rule over the day and over the night, and <b>to</b> divide the light from the darkness and God saw 
                    <em>THAT</em> it was good. And the evening and the morning <b>were</b> the fourth day. And God said, Let the waters <b>bring</b> forth abundantly the moving creature that hath life, and <b>fowl</b> that may fly above the earth in the open <b>firmament</b> of heaven. And God created great whales, and every <b>living</b> creature that moveth, which the waters brought forth abundantly, <b>after</b> their kind, and every winged fowl after his kind: <b>and</b> God saw that it was good. And God blessed <b>them,</b> saying, Be fruitful, and multiply, and fill the waters <b>in</b> the seas, and let fowl multiply in the earth. 
                    <em>AND</em> the evening and the morning were the fifth day. <b>And</b> God said, Let the earth bring forth the living <b>creature</b> after his kind, cattle, and creeping thing, and beast <b>of</b> the earth after his kind: and it was so. <b>And</b> God made the beast of the earth after his <b>kind,</b> and cattle after their kind, and every thing that <b>creepeth</b> upon the earth after his kind: and God saw <b>that</b> it was good. And God said, Let us make <b>man</b> in our image, after our likeness: and let them <b>have</b> dominion over the fish of the sea, and over 
                    <em>THE</em> fowl of the air, and over the cattle, and <b>over</b> all the earth, and over every creeping thing that <b>creepeth</b> upon the earth. So God created man in his <b>own</b> image, in the image of God created he him; <b>male</b> and female created he them. And God blessed them, <b>and</b> God said unto them, Be fruitful, and multiply, and <b>replenish</b> the earth, and subdue it: and have dominion over <b>the</b> fish of the sea, and over the fowl of <b>the</b> air, and over every living thing that moveth upon <b>the</b> earth. And God said, Behold, I have given you 
                    <em>EVERY</em> herb bearing seed, which is upon the face of <b>all</b> the earth, and every tree, in the which is <b>the</b> fruit of a tree yielding seed; to you it <b>shall</b> be for meat. And to every beast of the <b>earth,</b> and to every fowl of the air, and to <b>every</b> thing that creepeth upon the earth, wherein there is <b>life,</b> I have given every green herb for meat: and <b>it</b> was so. And God saw every thing that he <b>had</b> made, and, behold, it was very good. And the <b>evening</b> and the morning were the sixth day. Thus the 
                    <em>HEAVENS</em> and the earth were finished, and all the host <b>of</b> them. And on the seventh day God ended his <b>work</b> which he had made; and he rested on the <b>seventh</b> day from all his work which he had made. <b>And</b> God blessed the seventh day, and sanctified it: because <b>that</b> in it he had rested from all his work <b>which</b> God created and made. These are the generations of <b>the</b> heavens and of the earth when they were created, <b>in</b> the day that the Lord God made the earth <b>and</b> the heavens, and every plant of the field before 
                    <em>IT</em> was in the earth, and every herb of the <b>field</b> before it grew: for the Lord God had not <b>caused</b> it to rain upon the earth, and there was <b>not</b> a man to till the ground. But there went <b>up</b> a mist from the earth, and watered the whole <b>face</b> of the ground. And the Lord God formed man <b>of</b> the dust of the ground, and breathed into his <b>nostrils</b> the breath of life; and man became a living <b>soul.</b> And the Lord God planted a garden eastward in <b>Eden;</b> and there he put the man whom he had 
                    <em>FORMED.</em>

                <p class="writing">
                    Every Who Down in Whoville Liked Christmas a lot... <b>But</b> the Grinch, Who lived just north of Whoville, Did <b>NOT!</b> The Grinch hated Christmas! The whole Christmas season! Now, <b>please</b> don’t ask why. No one quite knows the reason. <b>It</b> could be his head wasn’t screwed on just right. <b>It</b> could be, perhaps, that his shoes were too tight. <b>But</b> I think that the most likely reason of all, <b>May</b> have been that his heart was two sizes too <b>small.</b> Whatever the reason, His heart or his shoes, He <b>stood</b> there on Christmas Eve, hating the Whos, Staring down 
                    <em>FROM</em> his cave with a sour, Grinchy frown, At the <b>warm</b> lighted windows below in their town. For he knew <b>every</b> Who down in Whoville beneath, Was busy now, hanging <b>a</b> mistletoe wreath. “And they’re hanging their stockings!” he snarled <b>with</b> a sneer, “Tomorrow is Christmas! It’s practically here!” Then <b>he</b> growled, with his Grinch fingers nervously drumming, “I MUST <b>find</b> some way to stop Christmas from coming!” For Tomorrow, <b>he</b> knew, all the Who girls and boys, Would wake <b>bright</b> and early. They’d rush for their toys! And then! <b>Oh,</b> the noise! Oh, the Noise! Noise! Noise! Noise! That’s 
                    <em>ONE</em> thing he hated! The NOISE! NOISE! NOISE! NOISE! Then <b>the</b> Whos, young and old, would sit down to a <b>feast.</b> And they’d feast! And they’d feast! And they’d FEAST! <b>FEAST!</b> FEAST! FEAST! They would feast on Who pudding, and <b>rare</b> Who roast beast. Which was something the Grinch couldn’t <b>stand</b> in the least! And THEN They’d do something He <b>liked</b> least of all! Every Who down in Whoville, the <b>tall</b> and the small, Would stand close together, with Christmas <b>bells</b> ringing. They’d stand hand in hand. And the Whos <b>would</b> start singing! They’d sing! And they’d sing! And they’d 
                    <em>SING!</em> SING! SING! SING! And the more the Grinch thought <b>of</b> this Who Christmas Sing, The more the Grinch thought, <b>“I</b> must stop this whole thing!” “Why, for fifty three <b>years</b> I’ve put up with it now!” “I MUST stop <b>this</b> Christmas from coming! But HOW?” Then he got an <b>idea!</b> An awful idea! THE GRINCH GOT A WONDERFUL, AWFUL <b>IDEA!</b> “I know just what to do!” The Grinch laughed <b>in</b> his throat. And he made a quick Santy Claus <b>hat</b> and a coat. And he chuckled, and clucked, “What <b>a</b> great Grinchy trick!” “With this coat and this hat, 
                    <em>I</em> look just like Saint Nick!” “All I need is <b>a</b> reindeer...” The Grinch looked around. But, since reindeer are <b>scarce,</b> there was none to be found. Did that stop <b>the</b> old Grinch? No! The Grinch simply said, “If I <b>can’t</b> find a reindeer, I’ll make one instead!” So he <b>called</b> his dog, Max. Then he took some red thread, <b>And</b> he tied a big horn on the top of <b>his</b> head. THEN He loaded some bags And some old <b>empty</b> sacks, On a ramshackle sleigh And he hitched up <b>old</b> Max. Then the Grinch said, “Giddap!” And the sleigh 
                    <em>STARTED</em> down, Toward the homes where the Whos Lay a <b>snooze</b> in their town. All their windows were dark. Quiet <b>snow</b> filled the air. All the Whos were all dreaming <b>sweet</b> dreams without care. When he came to the first <b>little</b> house on the square. “This is stop number one,” <b>the</b> old Grinchy Claus hissed, And he climbed to the <b>roof,</b> empty bags in his fist. Then he slid down <b>the</b> chimney. A rather tight pinch. But, if Santa could <b>do</b> it, then so could the Grinch. He got stuck <b>only</b> once, for a moment or two. Then he stuck 
                    <em>HIS</em> head out of the fireplace flue. Where the little <b>Who</b> stockings all hung in a row. “These stockings,” he <b>grinned,</b> “are the first things to go!” Then he slithered <b>and</b> slunk, with a smile most unpleasant, Around the whole <b>room,</b> and he took every present! Pop guns! And bicycles! <b>Roller</b> skates! Drums! Checkerboards! Tricycles! Popcorn! And plums! And he <b>stuffed</b> them in bags. Then the Grinch, very nimbly, Stuffed <b>all</b> the bags, one by one, up the chimney! Then <b>he</b> slunk to the icebox. He took the Whos’ feast! <b>He</b> took the Who pudding! He took the roast beast! 
                    <em>HE</em> cleaned out that icebox as quick as a flash. <b>Why,</b> that Grinch even took their last can of Who <b>hash!</b> Then he stuffed all the food up the chimney <b>with</b> glee. “And NOW!” grinned the Grinch, “I will stuff <b>up</b> the tree!” And the Grinch grabbed the tree, and <b>he</b> started to shove, When he heard a small sound <b>like</b> the coo of a dove. He turned around fast, <b>and</b> he saw a small Who! Little Cindy Lou Who, <b>who</b> was not more than two. The Grinch had been <b>caught</b> by this tiny Who daughter, Who’d got out of 
                    <em>BED</em> for a cup of cold water. She stared at <b>the</b> Grinch and said, “Santy Claus, why,” “Why are you <b>taking</b> our Christmas tree? WHY?” But, you know, that old <b>Grinch</b> was so smart and so slick, He thought up <b>a</b> lie, and he thought it up quick! “Why, my <b>sweet</b> little tot,” the fake Santy Claus lied, “There’s a <b>light</b> on this tree that won’t light on one side.” <b>“So</b> I’m taking it home to my workshop, my dear.” <b>“I’ll</b> fix it up there. Then I’ll bring it back <b>here.”</b> And his fib fooled the child. Then he patted 
                    <em>HER</em> head, And he got her a drink and he <b>sent</b> her to bed. And when CindyLou Who went to <b>bed</b> with her cup, HE went to the chimney and <b>stuffed</b> the tree up! Then the last thing he took <b>Was</b> the log for their fire! Then he went up <b>the</b> chimney, himself, the old liar. On their walls he <b>left</b> nothing but hooks and some wire. And the one <b>speck</b> of food That he left in the house, Was <b>a</b> crumb that was even too small for a mouse. <b>Then</b> He did the same thing To the other Whos’ 
                    <em>HOUSES.</em>

                    Call me Ishmael. Some years ago never mind how <b>long</b> precisely having little or no money in my purse, <b>and</b> nothing particular to interest me on shore, I thought <b>I</b> would sail about a little and see the watery <b>part</b> of the world. It is a way I have <b>of</b> driving off the spleen and regulating the circulation. Whenever <b>I</b> find myself growing grim about the mouth; whenever it <b>is</b> a damp, drizzly November in my soul; whenever I <b>find</b> myself involuntarily pausing before coffin warehouses, and bringing up <b>the</b> rear of every funeral I meet; and especially whenever 
                    <em>MY</em> hypos get such an upper hand of me, that <b>it</b> requires a strong moral principle to prevent me from <b>deliberately</b> stepping into the street, and methodically knocking people’s hats <b>off</b> then, I account it high time to get to <b>sea</b> as soon as I can. This is my substitute <b>for</b> pistol and ball. With a philosophical flourish Cato throws <b>himself</b> upon his sword; I quietly take to the ship. <b>There</b> is nothing surprising in this. If they but knew <b>it,</b> almost all men in their degree, some time or <b>other,</b> cherish very nearly the same feelings towards the ocean 
                    <em>WITH</em> me. There now is your insular city of the <b>Manhattoes,</b> belted round by wharves as Indian isles by coral <b>reefs</b> commerce surrounds it with her surf. Right and left, <b>the</b> streets take you waterward. Its extreme downtown is the <b>battery,</b> where that noble mole is washed by waves, and <b>cooled</b> by breezes, which a few hours previous were out <b>of</b> sight of land. Look at the crowds of water <b>gazers</b> there. Circumambulate the city of a dreamy Sabbath afternoon. <b>Go</b> from Corlears Hook to Coenties Slip, and from thence, <b>by</b> Whitehall, northward. What do you see? Posted like silent 
                    <em>SENTINELS</em> all around the town, stand thousands upon thousands of <b>mortal</b> men fixed in ocean reveries. Some leaning against the <b>spiles;</b> some seated upon the pier heads; some looking over <b>the</b> bulwarks of ships from China; some high aloft in <b>the</b> rigging, as if striving to get a still better <b>seaward</b> peep. But these are all landsmen; of week days <b>pent</b> up in lath and plaster tied to counters, nailed <b>to</b> benches, clinched to desks. How then is this? Are <b>the</b> green fields gone? What do they here? But look! <b>here</b> come more crowds, pacing straight for the water, and 
                    <em>SEEMINGLY</em> bound for a dive. Strange! Nothing will content them <b>but</b> the extremest limit of the land; loitering under the <b>shady</b> lee of yonder warehouses will not suffice. No. They <b>must</b> get just as nigh the water as they possibly <b>can</b> without falling in. And there they stand miles of <b>them</b> leagues. Inlanders all, they come from lanes and alleys, <b>streets</b> and avenues north, east, south, and west. Yet here <b>they</b> all unite. Tell me, does the magnetic virtue of <b>the</b> needles of the compasses of all those ships attract <b>them</b> thither? Once more. Say you are in the country; 
                    <em>IN</em> some high land of lakes. Take almost any path <b>you</b> please, and ten to one it carries you down <b>in</b> a dale, and leaves you there by a pool <b>in</b> the stream. There is magic in it. Let the <b>most</b> absent minded of men be plunged in his deepest <b>reveries</b> stand that man on his legs, set his feet <b>a</b> going, and he will infallibly lead you to water, <b>if</b> water there be in all that region. Should you <b>ever</b> be athirst in the great American desert, try this <b>experiment,</b> if your caravan happen to be supplied with a 
                    <em>METAPHYSICAL</em> professor. Yes, as everyone knows, meditation and water are <b>wedded</b> forever. But here is an artist. He desires to <b>paint</b> you the dreamiest, shadiest, quietest, most enchanting bit of <b>romantic</b> landscape in all the valley of the Saco. What <b>is</b> the chief element he employs? There stand his trees, <b>each</b> with a hollow trunk, as if a hermit and <b>a</b> crucifix were within; and here sleeps his meadow, and <b>there</b> sleep his cattle; and up from yonder cottage goes <b>a</b> sleepy smoke. Deep into distant woodlands winds a mazy <b>way,</b> reaching to overlapping spurs of mountains bathed in their 
                    <em>HILL</em> side blue. But though the picture lies thus tranced, <b>and</b> though this pine tree shakes down its sighs like <b>leaves</b> upon this shepherd’s head, yet all were vain, unless <b>the</b> shepherd’s eye were fixed upon the magic stream before <b>him.</b> Go visit the Prairies in June, when for scores <b>on</b> scores of miles you wade knee deep among Tiger <b>lilies</b> what is the one charm wanting? Water there is <b>not</b> a drop of water there! Were Niagara but a <b>cataract</b> of sand, would you travel your thousand miles to <b>see</b> it? Why did the poor poet of Tennessee, upon 
                    <em>SUDDENLY</em> receiving two handfuls of silver, deliberate whether to buy <b>him</b> a coat, which he sadly needed, or invest his <b>money</b> in a pedestrian trip to Rockaway Beach? Why is <b>almost</b> every robust healthy boy with a robust healthy soul <b>in</b> him, at some time or other crazy to go <b>to</b> sea? Why upon your first voyage as a passenger, <b>did</b> you yourself feel such a mystical vibration, when first <b>told</b> that you and your ship were now out of <b>sight</b> of land? Why did the old Persians hold the <b>sea</b> holy? Why did the Greeks give it a separate 
                    <em>DEITY,</em> and own brother of Jove? Surely all this is <b>not</b> without meaning. And still deeper the meaning of that <b>story</b> of Narcissus, who because he could not grasp the <b>tormenting,</b> mild image he saw in the fountain, plunged into <b>it</b> and was drowned. But that same image, we ourselves <b>see</b> in all rivers and oceans. It is the image <b>of</b> the ungraspable phantom of life; and this is the <b>key</b> to it all. Now, when I say that I <b>am</b> in the habit of going to sea whenever I <b>begin</b> to grow hazy about the eyes, and begin to

                <p class="writing medium">
                    Once upon a midnight dreary, while I pondered, weak <b>and</b> weary, Over many a quaint and curious volume of <b>forgotten</b> lore While I nodded, nearly napping, suddenly there came <b>a</b> tapping, As of some one gently rapping, rapping at <b>my</b> chamber door. “‘Tis some visitor,” I muttered, “tapping at <b>my</b> chamber door Only this and nothing more.” Ah, distinctly <b>I</b> remember it was in the bleak December; And each <b>separate</b> dying ember wrought its ghost upon the floor. Eagerly <b>I</b> wished the morrow; vainly I had sought to borrow <b>From</b> my books surcease of sorrow sorrow for the lost 
                    <em>LENORE</em> For the rare and radiant maiden whom the angels <b>name</b> Lenore Nameless here for evermore. And the silken, sad, <b>uncertain</b> rustling of each purple curtain Thrilled me filled me <b>with</b> fantastic terrors never felt before; So that now, to <b>still</b> the beating of my heart, I stood repeating “‘Tis <b>some</b> visitor entreating entrance at my chamber door Some late <b>visitor</b> entreating entrance at my chamber door; This it is <b>and</b> nothing more.” Presently my soul grew stronger; hesitating then <b>no</b> longer, “Sir,” said I, “or Madam, truly your forgiveness <b>I</b> implore; But the fact is I was napping, and 
                    <em>SO</em> gently you came rapping, And so faintly you came <b>tapping,</b> tapping at my chamber door, That I scarce was <b>sure</b> I heard you” here I opened wide the door; <b>Darkness</b> there and nothing more. Deep into that darkness peering, <b>long</b> I stood there wondering, fearing, Doubting, dreaming dreams no <b>mortal</b> ever dared to dream before; But the silence was <b>unbroken,</b> and the stillness gave no token, And the only <b>word</b> there spoken was the whispered word, “Lenore?” This I <b>whispered,</b> and an echo murmured back the word, “Lenore!” Merely <b>this</b> and nothing more. Back into the chamber turning, all 
                    <em>MY</em> soul within me burning, Soon again I heard a <b>tapping</b> somewhat louder than before. “Surely,” said I, “surely that <b>is</b> something at my window lattice; Let me see, then, <b>what</b> thereat is, and this mystery explore Let my heart <b>be</b> still a moment and this mystery explore; ‘Tis the <b>wind</b> and nothing more!” Open here I flung the shutter, <b>when,</b> with many a flirt and flutter, In there stepped <b>a</b> stately Raven of the saintly days of yore; Not <b>the</b> least obeisance made he; not a minute stopped or <b>stayed</b> he; But, with mien of lord or lady, perched 
                    <em>ABOVE</em> my chamber door Perched upon a bust of Pallas <b>just</b> above my chamber door Perched, and sat, and nothing <b>more.</b> Then this ebony bird beguiling my sad fancy into <b>smiling,</b> By the grave and stern decorum of the countenance <b>it</b> wore, “Though thy crest be shorn and shaven, thou,” <b>I</b> said, “art sure no craven, Ghastly grim and ancient <b>Raven</b> wandering from the Nightly shore Tell me what thy <b>lordly</b> name is on the Night’s Plutonian shore!” Quoth the <b>Raven</b> “Nevermore.” Much I marvelled this ungainly fowl to hear <b>discourse</b> so plainly, Though its answer little meaning little relevancy 
                    <em>BORE;</em> For we cannot help agreeing that no living human <b>being</b> Ever yet was blessed with seeing bird above his <b>chamber</b> door Bird or beast upon the sculptured bust above <b>his</b> chamber door, With such name as “Nevermore.” But the <b>Raven,</b> sitting lonely on the placid bust, spoke only That <b>one</b> word, as if his soul in that one word <b>he</b> did outpour. Nothing farther then he uttered not a <b>feather</b> then he fluttered Till I scarcely more than muttered <b>“Other</b> friends have flown before On the morrow he will <b>leave</b> me, as my Hopes have flown before.” Then the 
                    <em>BIRD</em> said “Nevermore.” Startled at the stillness broken by reply <b>so</b> aptly spoken, “Doubtless,” said I, “what it utters is <b>its</b> only stock and store Caught from some unhappy master <b>whom</b> unmerciful Disaster Followed fast and followed faster till his <b>songs</b> one burden bore Till the dirges of his Hope <b>that</b> melancholy burden bore Of ‘Never nevermore’.” But the Raven <b>still</b> beguiling all my fancy into smiling, Straight I wheeled <b>a</b> cushioned seat in front of bird, and bust and <b>door;</b> Then, upon the velvet sinking, I betook myself to <b>linking</b> Fancy unto fancy, thinking what this ominous bird of 
                    <em>YORE</em> What this grim, ungainly, ghastly, gaunt, and ominous bird <b>of</b> yore Meant in croaking “Nevermore.” This I sat engaged <b>in</b> guessing, but no syllable expressing To the fowl whose <b>fiery</b> eyes now burned into my bosom’s core; This and <b>more</b> I sat divining, with my head at ease reclining <b>On</b> the cushion’s velvet lining that the lamp-light gloated o’er, <b>But</b> whose velvet-violet lining with the lamp-light gloating o’er, She <b>shall</b> press, ah, nevermore! Then, methought, the air grew denser, <b>perfumed</b> from an unseen censer Swung by Seraphim whose foot-falls <b>tinkled</b> on the tufted floor. “Wretch,” I cried, “thy God 
                    <em>HATH</em> lent thee by these angels he hath sent thee <b>Respite</b> respite and nepenthe from thy memories of Lenore; Quaff, <b>oh</b> quaff this kind nepenthe and forget this lost Lenore!” <b>Quoth</b> the Raven “Nevermore.” “Prophet!” said I, “thing of evil! <b>prophet</b> still, if bird or devil! Whether Tempter sent, or <b>whether</b> tempest tossed thee here ashore, Desolate yet all undaunted, <b>on</b> this desert land enchanted On this home by Horror <b>haunted</b> tell me truly, I implore Is there is there <b>balm</b> in Gilead? tell me tell me, I implore!” Quoth <b>the</b> Raven “Nevermore.” “Prophet!” said I, “thing of evil! prophet 
                    <em>STILL,</em> if bird or devil! By that Heaven that bends <b>above</b> us by that God we both adore Tell this <b>soul</b> with sorrow laden if, within the distant Aidenn, It <b>shall</b> clasp a sainted maiden whom the angels name Lenore <b>Clasp</b> a rare and radiant maiden whom the angels name <b>Lenore.”</b> Quoth the Raven “Nevermore.” “Be that word our sign <b>of</b> parting, bird or fiend!” I shrieked, upstarting “Get thee <b>back</b> into the tempest and the Night’s Plutonian shore! Leave <b>no</b> black plume as a token of that lie thy <b>soul</b> hath spoken! Leave my loneliness unbroken! quit the bust

                <p class="writing medium">
                    It was a bright cold day in April, and <b>the</b> clocks were striking thirteen. Winston Smith, his chin nuzzled <b>into</b> his breast in an effort to escape the vile <b>wind,</b> slipped quickly through the glass doors of Victory Mansions, <b>though</b> not quickly enough to prevent a swirl of gritty <b>dust</b> from entering along with him. The hallway smelt of <b>boiled</b> cabbage and old rag mats. At one end of <b>it</b> a coloured poster, too large for indoor display, had <b>been</b> tacked to the wall. It depicted simply an enormous <b>face,</b> more than a metre wide: the face of a 
                    <em>MAN</em> of about forty-five, with a heavy black moustache and <b>ruggedly</b> handsome features. Winston made for the stairs. It was <b>no</b> use trying the lift. Even at the best of <b>times</b> it was seldom working, and at present the electric <b>current</b> was cut off during daylight hours. It was part <b>of</b> the economy drive in preparation for Hate Week. The <b>flat</b> was seven flights up, and Winston, who was thirty-nine <b>and</b> had a varicose ulcer above his right ankle, went <b>slowly,</b> resting several times on the way. On each landing, <b>opposite</b> the lift-shaft, the poster with the enormous face gazed 
                    <em>FROM</em> the wall. It was one of those pictures which <b>are</b> so contrived that the eyes follow you about when <b>you</b> move. BIG BROTHER IS WATCHING YOU, the caption beneath <b>it</b> ran. Inside the flat a fruity voice was reading <b>out</b> a list of figures which had something to do <b>with</b> the production of pig-iron. The voice came from an <b>oblong</b> metal plaque like a dulled mirror which formed part <b>of</b> the surface of the right-hand wall. Winston turned a <b>switch</b> and the voice sank somewhat, though the words were <b>still</b> distinguishable. The instrument (the telescreen, it was called) could 
                    <em>BE</em> dimmed, but there was no way of shutting it <b>off</b> completely. He moved over to the window: a smallish, <b>frail</b> figure, the meagreness of his body merely emphasized by <b>the</b> blue overalls which were the uniform of the party. <b>His</b> hair was very fair, his face naturally sanguine, his <b>skin</b> roughened by coarse soap and blunt razor blades and <b>the</b> cold of the winter that had just ended. Outside, <b>even</b> through the shut window-pane, the world looked cold. Down <b>in</b> the street little eddies of wind were whirling dust <b>and</b> torn paper into spirals, and though the sun was 
                    <em>SHINING</em> and the sky a harsh blue, there seemed to <b>be</b> no colour in anything, except the posters that were <b>plastered</b> everywhere. The blackmoustachio'd face gazed down from every commanding <b>corner.</b> There was one on the house-front immediately opposite. BIG <b>BROTHER</b> IS WATCHING YOU, the caption said, while the dark <b>eyes</b> looked deep into Winston's own. Down at streetlevel another <b>poster,</b> torn at one corner, flapped fitfully in the wind, <b>alternately</b> covering and uncovering the single word INGSOC. In the <b>far</b> distance a helicopter skimmed down between the roofs, hovered <b>for</b> an instant like a bluebottle, and darted away again 
                    <em>WITH</em> a curving flight. It was the police patrol, snooping <b>into</b> people's windows. The patrols did not matter, however. Only <b>the</b> Thought Police mattered. Behind Winston's back the voice from <b>the</b> telescreen was still babbling away about pig-iron and the <b>overfulfilment</b> of the Ninth Three-Year Plan. The telescreen received and <b>transmitted</b> simultaneously. Any sound that Winston made, above the level <b>of</b> a very low whisper, would be picked up by <b>it,</b> moreover, so long as he remained within the field <b>of</b> vision which the metal plaque commanded, he could be <b>seen</b> as well as heard. There was of course no 
                    <em>WAY</em> of knowing whether you were being watched at any <b>given</b> moment. How often, or on what system, the Thought <b>Police</b> plugged in on any individual wire was guesswork. It <b>was</b> even conceivable that they watched everybody all the time. <b>But</b> at any rate they could plug in your wire <b>whenever</b> they wanted to. You had to live -- did <b>live,</b> from habit that became instinct -- in the assumption <b>that</b> every sound you made was overheard, and, except in <b>darkness,</b> every movement scrutinized. Winston kept his back turned to <b>the</b> telescreen. It was safer, though, as he well knew, 
                    <em>EVEN</em> a back can be revealing. A kilometre away the <b>Ministry</b> of Truth, his place of work, towered vast and <b>white</b> above the grimy landscape. This, he thought with a <b>sort</b> of vague distaste -- this was London, chief city <b>of</b> Airstrip One, itself the third most populous of the <b>provinces</b> of Oceania. He tried to squeeze out some childhood <b>memory</b> that should tell him whether London had always been <b>quite</b> like this. Were there always these vistas of rotting <b>nineteenth-century</b> houses, their sides shored up with baulks of timber, <b>their</b> windows patched with cardboard and their roofs with corrugated 
                    <em>IRON,</em> their crazy garden walls sagging in all directions? And <b>the</b> bombed sites where the plaster dust swirled in the <b>air</b> and the willow-herb straggled over the heaps of rubble; <b>and</b> the places where the bombs had cleared a larger <b>patch</b> and there had sprung up sordid colonies of wooden <b>dwellings</b> like chicken-houses? But it was no use, he could <b>not</b> remember: nothing remained of his childhood except a series <b>of</b> bright-lit tableaux occurring against no background and mostly unintelligible. <b>The</b> Ministry of Truth -- Minitrue, in Newspeak -- was <b>startlingly</b> different from any other object in sight. It was 
                    <em>AN</em> enormous pyramidal structure of glittering white concrete, soaring up, <b>terrace</b> after terrace, 300 metres into the air. From where <b>Winston</b> stood it was just possible to read, picked out <b>on</b> its white face in elegant lettering, the three slogans <b>of</b> the Party: WAR IS PEACE FREEDOM IS SLAVERY IGNORANCE <b>IS</b> STRENGTH The Ministry of Truth contained, it was said, <b>three</b> thousand rooms above ground level, and corresponding ramifications below. <b>Scattered</b> about London there were just three other buildings of <b>similar</b> appearance and size. So completely did they dwarf the <b>surrounding</b> architecture that from the roof of Victory Mansions you 
                    <em>COULD</em> see all four of them...

                <p class="writing">
                    True! nervous very, very dreadfully nervous I had been <b>and</b> am; but why will you say that I am <b>mad?</b> The disease had sharpened my senses not destroyed not <b>dulled</b> them. Above all was the sense of hearing acute. <b>I</b> heard all things in the heaven and in the <b>earth.</b> I heard many things in hell. How, then, am <b>I</b> mad? Hearken! and observe how healthily how calmly I <b>can</b> tell you the whole story. It is impossible to <b>say</b> how first the idea entered my brain; but once <b>conceived,</b> it haunted me day and night. Object there was 
                    <em>NONE.</em> Passion there was none. I loved the old man. <b>He</b> had never wronged me. He had never given me <b>insult.</b> For his gold I had no desire. I think <b>it</b> was his eye! yes, it was this! He had <b>the</b> eye of a vulture a pale blue eye, with <b>a</b> film over it. Whenever it fell upon me, my <b>blood</b> ran cold; and so by degrees very gradually I <b>made</b> up my mind to take the life of the <b>old</b> man, and thus rid myself of the eye forever. <b>Now</b> this is the point. You fancy me mad. Madmen 
                    <em>KNOW</em> nothing. But you should have seen me. You should <b>have</b> seen how wisely I proceeded with what caution with <b>what</b> foresight with what dissimulation I went to work! I <b>was</b> never kinder to the old man than during the <b>whole</b> week before I killed him. And every night, about <b>midnight,</b> I turned the latch of his door and opened <b>it</b> oh so gently! And then, when I had made <b>an</b> opening sufficient for my head, I put in a <b>dark</b> lantern, all closed, closed, that no light shone out, <b>and</b> then I thrust in my head. Oh, you would 
                    <em>HAVE</em> laughed to see how cunningly I thrust it in! <b>I</b> moved it slowly very, very slowly, so that I <b>might</b> not disturb the old man’s sleep. It took me <b>an</b> hour to place my whole head within the opening <b>so</b> far that I could see him as he lay <b>upon</b> his bed. Ha! would a madman have been so <b>wise</b> as this, And then, when my head was well <b>in</b> the room, I undid the lantern cautiously-oh, so cautiously <b>cautiously</b> (for the hinges creaked) I undid it just so <b>much</b> that a single thin ray fell upon the vulture 
                    <em>EYE.</em> And this I did for seven long nights every <b>night</b> just at midnight but I found the eye always <b>closed;</b> and so it was impossible to do the work; <b>for</b> it was not the old man who vexed me, <b>but</b> his Evil Eye. And every morning, when the day <b>broke,</b> I went boldly into the chamber, and spoke courageously <b>to</b> him, calling him by name in a hearty tone, <b>and</b> inquiring how he has passed the night. So you <b>see</b> he would have been a very profound old man, <b>indeed,</b> to suspect that every night, just at twelve, I 
                    <em>LOOKED</em> in upon him while he slept. Upon the eighth <b>night</b> I was more than usually cautious in opening the <b>door.</b> A watch’s minute hand moves more quickly than did <b>mine.</b> Never before that night had I felt the extent <b>of</b> my own powers of my sagacity. I could scarcely <b>contain</b> my feelings of triumph. To think that there I <b>was,</b> opening the door, little by little, and he not <b>even</b> to dream of my secret deeds or thoughts. I <b>fairly</b> chuckled at the idea; and perhaps he heard me; <b>for</b> he moved on the bed suddenly, as if startled. 
                    <em>NOW</em> you may think that I drew back but no. <b>His</b> room was as black as pitch with the thick <b>darkness,</b> (for the shutters were close fastened, through fear of <b>robbers,)</b> and so I knew that he could not see <b>the</b> opening of the door, and I kept pushing it <b>on</b> steadily, steadily. I had my head in, and was <b>about</b> to open the lantern, when my thumb slipped upon <b>the</b> tin fastening, and the old man sprang up in <b>bed,</b> crying out “Who’s there?” I kept quite still and <b>said</b> nothing. For a whole hour I did not move 
                    <em>A</em> muscle, and in the meantime I did not hear <b>him</b> lie down. He was still sitting up in the <b>bed</b> listening; just as I have done, night after night, <b>hearkening</b> to the death watches in the wall. Presently I <b>heard</b> a slight groan, and I knew it was the <b>groan</b> of mortal terror. It was not a groan of <b>pain</b> or of grief oh, no! it was the low <b>stifled</b> sound that arises from the bottom of the soul <b>when</b> overcharged with awe. I knew the sound well. Many <b>a</b> night, just at midnight, when all the world slept, 
                    <em>IT</em> has welled up from my own bosom, deepening, with <b>its</b> dreadful echo, the terrors that distracted me. I say <b>I</b> knew it well. I knew what the old man <b>felt,</b> and pitied him, although I chuckled at heart. I <b>knew</b> that he had been lying awake ever since the <b>first</b> slight noise, when he had turned in the bed. <b>His</b> fears had been ever since growing upon him. He <b>had</b> been trying to fancy them causeless, but could not. <b>He</b> had been saying to himself “It is nothing but <b>the</b> wind in the chimney it is only a mouse 
                    <em>CROSSING</em> the floor,” or “It is merely a cricket which <b>has</b> made a single chirp.” Yes, he had been trying <b>to</b> comfort himself with these suppositions: but he had found <b>all</b> in vain. All in vain; because Death, in approaching <b>him</b> had stalked with his black shadow before him, and <b>enveloped</b> the victim. And it was the mournful influence of <b>the</b> unperceived shadow that caused him to feel although he <b>neither</b> saw nor heard to feel the presence of my <b>head</b> within the room. When I had waited a long <b>time,</b> very patiently, without hearing him lie down, I resolved

                    <em>BE</em> disarmed. Each module is discrete and can be disarmed <b>in</b> any order. Instructions for disarming modules can be found <b>in</b> Section 1. “Needy” modules present a special case and <b>are</b> described in Section 2. Strikes When the Defuser makes <b>a</b> mistake, the bomb will record a strike which will <b>be</b> displayed on the indicator above the countdown timer. Bombs <b>with</b> a strike indicator will explode upon the third strike. <b>The</b> timer will begin to count down faster after a <b>strike</b> has been recorded. If no strike indicator is present <b>above</b> the countdown timer, the bomb will explode upon the 
                    <em>FIRST</em> strike, leaving no room for error. Gathering Information Some <b>disarming</b> instructions will require specific information about the bomb, such <b>as</b> the serial number. This type of information can typically <b>be</b> found on the top, bottom, or sides of the <b>bomb</b> casing. See Appendix A, B, and C for identification <b>instructions</b> that will be useful in disarming certain modules. Section <b>1:</b> Modules Modules can be identified by an LED in <b>the</b> top right corner. When this LED is lit green, <b>the</b> module has been disarmed. All modules must be disarmed <b>to</b> defuse the bomb. On the Subject of Wires Wires 
                    <em>ARE</em> the lifeblood of electronics! Wait, no, electricity is the <b>lifeblood.</b> Wires are more like the arteries. The veins? No <b>matter...</b> A wire module can have 3-6 wires on it. <b>Only</b> the one correct wire needs to be cut to <b>disarm</b> the module. Wire ordering begins with the first on <b>the</b> top. 3 wires: If there are no red wires, <b>cut</b> the second wire. Otherwise, if the last wire is <b>white,</b> cut the last wire. Otherwise, if there is more <b>than</b> one blue wire, cut the last blue wire. Otherwise, <b>cut</b> the last wire. 4 wires: If there is more 
                    <em>THAN</em> one red wire and the last digit of the <b>serial</b> number is odd, cut the last red wire. Otherwise, <b>if</b> the last wire is yellow and there are no <b>red</b> wires, cut the first wire. Otherwise, if there is <b>exactly</b> one blue wire, cut the first wire. Otherwise, if <b>there</b> is more than one yellow wire, cut the last <b>wire.</b> Otherwise, cut the second wire. 5 wires: If the <b>last</b> wire is black and the last digit of the <b>serial</b> number is odd, cut the fourth wire. Otherwise, if <b>there</b> is exactly one red wire and there is more 
                    <em>THAN</em> one yellow wire, cut the first wire. Otherwise, if <b>there</b> are no black wires, cut the second wire. Otherwise, <b>cut</b> the first wire. 6 wires: If there are no <b>yellow</b> wires and the last digit of the serial number <b>is</b> odd, cut the third wire. Otherwise, if there is <b>exactly</b> one yellow wire and there is more than one <b>white</b> wire, cut the fourth wire. Otherwise, if there are <b>no</b> red wires, cut the last wire. Otherwise, cut the <b>fourth</b> wire. On the Subject of The Button You might <b>think</b> that a button telling you to press it is 
                    <em>PRETTY</em> straightforward. That’s the kind of thinking that gets people <b>exploded.</b> See Appendix A for indicator identification reference. See Appendix <b>B</b> for battery identification reference. Follow these rules in the <b>order</b> they are listed. Perform the first action that applies: <b>If</b> the button is blue and the button says “Abort”, <b>hold</b> the button and refer to “Releasing a Held Button”. <b>If</b> there is more than 1 battery on the bomb <b>and</b> the button says “Detonate”, press and immediately release the <b>button.</b> If the button is white and there is a <b>lit</b> indicator with label CAR, hold the button and refer 
                    <em>TO</em> “Releasing a Held Button”. If there are more than <b>2</b> batteries on the bomb and there is a lit <b>indicator</b> with label FRK, press and immediately release the button. <b>If</b> the button is yellow, hold the button and refer <b>to</b> “Releasing a Held Button”. If the button is red <b>and</b> the button says “Hold”, press and immediately release the <b>button.</b> If none of the above apply, hold the button <b>and</b> refer to “Releasing a Held Button”. Releasing a Held <b>Button</b> If you start holding the button down, a colored <b>strip</b> will light up on the right side of the 
                    <em>MODULE.</em> Based on its color, you must release the button <b>at</b> a specific point in time: Blue strip: release when <b>the</b> countdown timer has a 4 in any position. White <b>strip:</b> release when the countdown timer has a 1 in <b>any</b> position. Yellow strip: release when the countdown timer has <b>a</b> 5 in any position. Any other color strip: release <b>when</b> the countdown timer has a 1 in any position. <b>On</b> the Subject of Keypads I’m not sure what these <b>symbols</b> are, but I suspect they have something to do <b>with</b> occult. Only one column below has all four of 
                    <em>THE</em> symbols from the keypad. Press the four buttons in <b>the</b> order their symbols appear from top to bottom within <b>that</b> column. On the Subject of Simon Says This is <b>like</b> one of those toys you played with as a <b>kid</b> where you have to match the pattern that appears, <b>except</b> this one is a knockoff that was probably purchased <b>at</b> a dollar store. One of the four colored buttons <b>will</b> flash. Using the correct table below, press the button <b>with</b> the corresponding color. The original button will flash, followed <b>by</b> another. Repeat this sequence in order using the color

                <p class="writing small">
                    Valve respects the privacy of its online visitors and <b>customers</b> of its products and services and complies with applicable <b>laws</b> for the protection of your privacy, including, without limitation, <b>the</b> California Consumer Privacy Act (“CCPA”), the European Union General <b>Data</b> Protection Regulation (“GDPR”) and the UK GDPR. 1. Definitions <b>Wherever</b> we talk about Personal Data below, we mean any <b>information</b> that can either itself identify you as an individual <b>(“Personally</b> Identifying Information”) or that can be connected to you <b>indirectly</b> by linking it to Personally Identifying Information. Valve also <b>processes</b> anonymous data, aggregated or not, to analyze and produce 
                    <em>STATISTICS</em> related to the habits, usage patterns, and demographics of <b>customers</b> as a group or as individuals. Such anonymous data <b>does</b> not allow the identification of the customers to which <b>it</b> relates. Valve may share anonymous data, aggregated or not, <b>with</b> third parties. Other capitalized terms in this Privacy Policy <b>shall</b> have the meanings defined in the Steam Subscriber Agreement <b>(“SSA”).</b> 2. Why Valve Collects and Processes Data Valve collects <b>and</b> processes Personal Data for the following reasons: a) where <b>it</b> is necessary for the performance of our agreement with <b>you</b> to provide a full-featured gaming service and deliver associated 
                    <em>CONTENT</em> and Services; b) where it is necessary for compliance <b>with</b> legal obligations that we are subject to (e.g. our <b>obligations</b> to keep certain information under tax laws); c) where <b>it</b> is necessary for the purposes of the legitimate and <b>legal</b> interests of Valve or a third party (e.g. the <b>interests</b> of our other customers), except where such interests are <b>overridden</b> by your prevailing legitimate interests and rights; or d) <b>where</b> you have given consent to it. These reasons for <b>collecting</b> and processing Personal Data determine and limit what Personal <b>Data</b> we collect and how we use it (section 3. 
                    <em>BELOW),</em> how long we store it (section 4. below), who <b>has</b> access to it (section 5. below) and what rights <b>and</b> other control mechanisms are available to you as a <b>user</b> (section 6. below). 3. The Types and Sources of <b>Data</b> We Collect 3.1 Basic Account Data When setting up <b>an</b> Account, Valve will collect your email address and country <b>of</b> residence. You are also required to choose a user <b>name</b> and a password. The provision of this information is <b>necessary</b> to register a Steam User Account. During setup of <b>your</b> account, the account is automatically assigned a number (the 
                    <em>“STEAM</em> ID”) that is later used to reference your user <b>account</b> without directly exposing Personally Identifying Information about you. We <b>do</b> not require you to provide or use your real <b>name</b> for the setup of a Steam User Account. 3.2 <b>Transaction</b> and Payment Data In order to make a transaction <b>on</b> Steam (e.g. to purchase Subscriptions for Content and Services <b>or</b> to fund your Steam Wallet), you may need to <b>provide</b> payment data to Valve to enable the transaction. If <b>you</b> pay by credit card, you need to provide typical <b>credit</b> card information (name, address, credit card number, expiration date 
                    <em>AND</em> security code) to Valve, which Valve will process and <b>transmit</b> to the payment service provider of your choice to <b>enable</b> the transaction and perform anti-fraud checks. Likewise, Valve will <b>receive</b> data from your payment service provider for the same <b>reasons.</b> 3.3 Other Data You Explicitly Submit We will collect <b>and</b> process Personal Data whenever you explicitly provide it to <b>us</b> or send it as part of communication with others <b>on</b> Steam, e.g. in Steam Community Forums, chats, or when <b>you</b> provide feedback or other user generated content. This data <b>includes:</b> Information that you post, comment or follow in any 
                    <em>OF</em> our Content and Services; Information sent through chat; Information <b>you</b> provide when you request information or support from us <b>or</b> purchase Content and Services from us, including information necessary <b>to</b> process your orders with the relevant payment merchant or, <b>in</b> case of physical goods, shipping providers; Information you provide <b>to</b> us when participating in competitions, contests and tournaments or <b>responding</b> to surveys, e.g. your contact details. 3.4 Your Use <b>of</b> the Steam Client and Websites We collect a variety <b>of</b> information through your general interaction with the websites, Content <b>and</b> Services offered by Steam. Personal Data we collect may 
                    <em>INCLUDE,</em> but is not limited to, browser and device information, <b>data</b> collected through automated electronic interactions and application usage data. <b>Likewise,</b> we will track your process across our websites and <b>applications</b> to verify that you are not a bot and <b>to</b> optimize our services. 3.5 Your Use of Games and <b>other</b> Subscriptions In order to provide you with services, we <b>need</b> to collect, store and use various information about your <b>activity</b> in our Content and Services. “Content-Related Information” includes your <b>Steam</b> ID, as well as what is usually referred to <b>as</b> “game statistics”. By game statistics we mean information about 
                    <em>YOUR</em> games’ preferences, progress in the games, playtime, as well <b>as</b> information about the device you are using, including what <b>operating</b> system you are using, device settings, unique device identifiers, <b>and</b> crash data. 3.6 Tracking Data and Cookies We use <b>“Cookies”,</b> which are text files placed on your computer, and <b>similar</b> technologies (e.g. web beacons, pixels, ad tags and device <b>identifiers)</b> to help us analyze how users use our services, <b>as</b> well as to improve the services we are offering, <b>to</b> improve marketing, analytics or website functionality. The use of <b>Cookies</b> is standard on the internet. Although most web browsers 
                    <em>AUTOMATICALLY</em> accept cookies, the decision of whether to accept or <b>not</b> is yours. You may adjust your browser settings to <b>prevent</b> the reception of cookies, or to provide notification whenever <b>a</b> cookie is sent to you. You can manage the <b>use</b> of optional cookies by clicking on the “Cookies setting” <b>page</b> accessible via the cookie banner displayed when you first <b>visit</b> our website and at any time through the Cookie <b>Settings</b> page available here.

                <p class="writing medium">
                    The unanimous Declaration of the thirteen united States of <b>America,</b> When in the Course of human events, it becomes <b>necessary</b> for one people to dissolve the political bands which <b>have</b> connected them with another, and to assume among the <b>powers</b> of the earth, the separate and equal station to <b>which</b> the Laws of Nature and of Nature’s God entitle <b>them,</b> a decent respect to the opinions of mankind requires <b>that</b> they should declare the causes which impel them to <b>the</b> separation. We hold these truths to be self-evident, that <b>all</b> men are created equal, that they are endowed by 
                    <em>THEIR</em> Creator with certain unalienable Rights, that among these are <b>Life,</b> Liberty and the pursuit of Happiness. That to secure <b>these</b> rights, Governments are instituted among Men, deriving their just <b>powers</b> from the consent of the governed, That whenever any <b>Form</b> of Government becomes destructive of these ends, it is <b>the</b> Right of the People to alter or to abolish <b>it,</b> and to institute new Government, laying its foundation on <b>such</b> principles and organizing its powers in such form, as <b>to</b> them shall seem most likely to effect their Safety <b>and</b> Happiness. Prudence, indeed, will dictate that Governments long established 
                    <em>SHOULD</em> not be changed for light and transient causes; and <b>accordingly</b> all experience hath shewn, that mankind are more disposed <b>to</b> suffer, while evils are sufferable, than to right themselves <b>by</b> abolishing the forms to which they are accustomed. But <b>when</b> a long train of abuses and usurpations, pursuing invariably <b>the</b> same Object evinces a design to reduce them under <b>absolute</b> Despotism, it is their right, it is their duty, <b>to</b> throw off such Government, and to provide new Guards <b>for</b> their future security. Such has been the patient sufferance <b>of</b> these Colonies; and such is now the necessity which 
                    <em>CONSTRAINS</em> them to alter their former Systems of Government. The <b>history</b> of the present King of Great Britain is a <b>history</b> of repeated injuries and usurpations, all having in direct <b>object</b> the establishment of an absolute Tyranny over these States. <b>To</b> prove this, let Facts be submitted to a candid <b>world.</b> He has refused his Assent to Laws, the most <b>wholesome</b> and necessary for the public good. He has forbidden <b>his</b> Governors to pass Laws of immediate and pressing importance, <b>unless</b> suspended in their operation till his Assent should be <b>obtained;</b> and when so suspended, he has utterly neglected to 
                    <em>ATTEND</em> to them. He has refused to pass other Laws <b>for</b> the accommodation of large districts of people, unless those <b>people</b> would relinquish the right of Representation in the Legislature, <b>a</b> right inestimable to them and formidable to tyrants only. <b>He</b> has called together legislative bodies at places unusual, uncomfortable, <b>and</b> distant from the depository of their public Records, for <b>the</b> sole purpose of fatiguing them into compliance with his <b>measures.</b> He has dissolved Representative Houses repeatedly, for opposing with <b>manly</b> firmness his invasions on the rights of the people. <b>He</b> has refused for a long time, after such dissolutions, 
                    <em>TO</em> cause others to be elected; whereby the Legislative powers, <b>incapable</b> of Annihilation, have returned to the People at large <b>for</b> their exercise; the State remaining in the mean time <b>exposed</b> to all the dangers of invasion from without, and <b>convulsions</b> within. He has endeavoured to prevent the population of <b>these</b> States; for that purpose obstructing the Laws for Naturalization <b>of</b> Foreigners; refusing to pass others to encourage their migrations <b>hither,</b> and raising the conditions of new Appropriations of Lands. <b>He</b> has obstructed the Administration of Justice, by refusing his <b>Assent</b> to Laws for establishing Judiciary powers. He has made

                <h4 id="ATourOfTheCsharpLanguage"><a href="https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/dotnet/csharp/tour-of-csharp/">A Tour of the C# Language</a></h4>
                <p class="writing small">
                    C# (pronounced “See Sharp”) is a modern, object-oriented, and <b>type-safe</b> programming language. C# enables developers to build many types <b>of</b> secure and robust applications that run in .NET. C# <b>has</b> its roots in the C family of languages and <b>will</b> be immediately familiar to C, C++, Java, and JavaScript <b>programmers.</b> This tour provides an overview of the major components <b>of</b> the language in C# 11 and earlier. If you <b>want</b> to explore the language through interactive examples, try the <b>introduction</b> to C# tutorials. C# is an object-oriented, component-oriented programming <b>language.</b> C# provides language constructs to directly support these concepts, 
                    <em>MAKING</em> C# a natural language in which to create and <b>use</b> software components. Since its origin, C# has added features <b>to</b> support new workloads and emerging software design practices. At <b>its</b> core, C# is an object-oriented language. You define types <b>and</b> their behavior. Several C# features help create robust and <b>durable</b> applications. Garbage collection automatically reclaims memory occupied by unreachable <b>unused</b> objects. Nullable types guard against variables that don’t refer <b>to</b> allocated objects. Exception handling provides a structured and extensible <b>approach</b> to error detection and recovery. Lambda expressions support functional <b>programming</b> techniques. Language Integrated Query (LINQ) syntax creates a common 
                    <em>PATTERN</em> for working with data from any source. Language support <b>for</b> asynchronous operations provides syntax for building distributed systems. C# <b>has</b> a unified type system. All C# types, including primitive <b>types</b> such as int and double, inherit from a single <b>root</b> object type. All types share a set of common <b>operations.</b> Values of any type can be stored, transported, and <b>operated</b> upon in a consistent manner. Furthermore, C# supports both <b>user-defined</b> reference types and value types. C# allows dynamic allocation <b>of</b> objects and in-line storage of lightweight structures. C# supports <b>generic</b> methods and types, which provide increased type safety and 
                    <em>PERFORMANCE.</em> C# provides iterators, which enable implementers of collection classes <b>to</b> define custom behaviors for client code. C# emphasizes versioning <b>to</b> ensure programs and libraries can evolve over time in <b>a</b> compatible manner. Aspects of C#’s design that were directly <b>influenced</b> by versioning considerations include the separate virtual and override <b>modifiers,</b> the rules for method overload resolution, and support for <b>explicit</b> interface member declarations. .NET architecture C# programs run on <b>.NET,</b> a virtual execution system called the common language runtime <b>(CLR)</b> and a set of class libraries. The CLR is <b>the</b> implementation by Microsoft of the common language infrastructure (CLI), 
                    <em>AN</em> international standard. The CLI is the basis for creating <b>execution</b> and development environments in which languages and libraries work <b>together</b> seamlessly. Source code written in C# is compiled into <b>an</b> intermediate language (IL) that conforms to the CLI specification. <b>The</b> IL code and resources, such as bitmaps and strings, <b>are</b> stored in an assembly, typically with an extension of <b>.dll.</b> An assembly contains a manifest that provides information about <b>the</b> assembly’s types, version, and culture. When the C# program <b>is</b> executed, the assembly is loaded into the CLR. The <b>CLR</b> performs Just-In-Time (JIT) compilation to convert the IL code 
                    <em>TO</em> native machine instructions. The CLR provides other services related <b>to</b> automatic garbage collection, exception handling, and resource management. Code <b>that’s</b> executed by the CLR is sometimes referred to as <b>“managed</b> code.” “Unmanaged code,” is compiled into native machine language <b>that</b> targets a specific platform. Language interoperability is a key <b>feature</b> of .NET. IL code produced by the C# compiler <b>conforms</b> to the Common Type Specification (CTS). IL code generated <b>from</b> C# can interact with code that was generated from <b>the</b> .NET versions of F#, Visual Basic, C++. There are <b>more</b> than 20 other CTS-compliant languages. A single assembly may 
                    <em>CONTAIN</em> multiple modules written in different .NET languages. The types <b>can</b> reference each other as if they were written in <b>the</b> same language. In addition to the runtime services, .NET <b>also</b> includes extensive libraries. These libraries support many different workloads. <b>They’re</b> organized into namespaces that provide a wide variety of <b>useful</b> functionality. The libraries include everything from file input and <b>output</b> to string manipulation to XML parsing, to web application <b>frameworks</b> to Windows Forms controls. The typical C# application uses <b>the</b> .NET class library extensively to handle common “plumbing” chores. <b>For</b> more information about .NET, see Overview of .NET. Hello 
                    <em>WORLD</em> The “Hello, World” program is traditionally used to introduce <b>a</b> programming language. Here it is in C#: The “Hello, <b>World”</b> program starts with a using directive that references the <b>System</b> namespace. Namespaces provide a hierarchical means of organizing C# <b>programs</b> and libraries. Namespaces contain types and other namespaces—for example, <b>the</b> System namespace contains a number of types, such as <b>the</b> Console class referenced in the program, and many other <b>namespaces,</b> such as IO and Collections. A using directive that <b>references</b> a given namespace enables unqualified use of the types <b>that</b> are members of that namespace. The Hello class declared 
                    <em>BY</em> the “Hello, World” program has a single member, the <b>method</b> named Main. The Main method is declared with the <b>static</b> modifier. While instance methods can reference a particular enclosing <b>object</b> instance using the keyword this, static methods operate without <b>reference</b> to a particular object. By convention, a static method <b>named</b> Main serves as the entry point of a C# <b>program.</b> The output of the program is produced by the <b>WriteLine</b> method of the Console class in the System namespace. <b>This</b> class is provided by the standard class libraries, which, <b>by</b> default, are automatically referenced by the compiler. You use 
                    <em>THE</em> .NET SDK to build your own “Hello, World” program. <b>Once</b> you install the SDK, you run dotnet new console <b>to</b> create a basic “Hello, World” program that you can <b>modify.</b> For more information, see the Hello, World tutorial in <b>the</b> .NET Get started section. Types and variables A type <b>defines</b> the structure and behavior of any data in C#. <b>The</b> declaration of a type may include its members, base <b>type,</b> interfaces it implements, and operations permitted for that type. <b>A</b> variable is a label that refers to an instance <b>of</b> a specific type. There are two kinds of types

                <h4 id="TheDiaryOfAWimpyKid"><a href="Brown Cipher.html">The Diary of a Wimpy Kid</a></h4>
                <p class="writing">
                    First of all, I want to get something straight: <b>this</b> is a JOURNAL, not a diary. I know what <b>it</b> says on the cover but when Mom went out <b>to</b> buy this thing I SPECIFICALLY said to make sure <b>it</b> didn’t say "diary" on it. So don’t expect me <b>to</b> be all "dear diary this" and "dear diary that". <b>All</b> I need is for some jerk to catch me <b>carrying</b> this thing around and get the wrong idea. The <b>other</b> thing I want to clear up right away is <b>how</b> this was NOT my idea, it was Mom’s. The 
                    <em>DEAL</em> is that if I write in this book a <b>little</b> bit each day I get out of one chore <b>on</b> Saturdays, so of course I picked the one I <b>hate</b> the most. But if Rodrick ever finds out he’s <b>scrubbing</b> toilets because of this book, I’m dead. Oh yeah <b>Rodrick’s</b> my brother. I try to avoid him anyway but <b>now</b> that I struck this deal with Mom, I better <b>be</b> extra careful. Anyway I think Mom has this idea <b>I’m</b> going to write down my "feelings" and all that, <b>but</b> she’s not actually allowed to read it so I 
                    <em>FIGURE</em> I’ll just write what I want. The real reason <b>I</b> agreed to do this at all is because I <b>figure</b> later on when I’m rich and famous I’ll have <b>better</b> things to do than answer people’s stupid questions all <b>day</b> long. Like I said, one day I will definitely <b>be</b> famous, but for now I’m stuck in the seventh <b>grade</b> with a bunch of morons. Today is the first <b>day</b> of school and right now we’re just waiting around <b>for</b> the teacher to hurry up and finish the seating <b>chart.</b> So I figured I might as well write in 
                    <em>THIS</em> book and just get it over with for the <b>day.</b> But I’ll tell you something... on the first day <b>of</b> school, you got to be real careful of where <b>you</b> sit. You walk into the classroom and just plunk <b>your</b> stuff down on any old desk and the next <b>thing</b> you know the teacher is saying "I hope you <b>all</b> like where you’re sitting because these are your permanent <b>seats".</b> So in this class I got stuck with Chris <b>Hosey</b> in front of me and Lionel James in back <b>of</b> me. Otha Harris came in late and almost sat 
                    <em>NEXT</em> to me but luckily I did some quick thinking <b>and</b> got myself out of that one. I’m thinking for <b>next</b> period I should just sit in the middle of <b>a</b> bunch of cute girls as soon as I step <b>in</b> the room. Then again if I do that it <b>just</b> proves that I didn’t learn a thing from last <b>year.</b> Plus the other thing I got to think about <b>is</b> that girls don’t let you copy off of them, <b>which</b> could be a real problem in a class like <b>Pre</b> Algebra. Speaking of seating, something that really stunk today 
                    <em>IS</em> how in home room I got stuck with some <b>teacher</b> who had Rodrick in his class a few years <b>back.</b> The only good thing I can think about the <b>first</b> day of school is that some of the teachers <b>are</b> new and so you can slide a little. Anyway <b>the</b> teacher is almost done with the seating chart and <b>I</b> think I wrote enough in this book to keep <b>Mom</b> off my back for today. This morning Mom made <b>me</b> lend my brother Rodrick some of my money so <b>he</b> could buy lunch, which really stunk. I’m still mad 
                    <em>AT</em> Rodrick for the trick he pulled on me at <b>the</b> beginning of the summer so I’m really not looking <b>to</b> do him any favors. What happened was that on <b>the</b> first day of summer vacation, he woke me up <b>in</b> the middle of the night dressed up in his <b>school</b> clothes. He told me I slept through the whole <b>summer</b> but that luckily I had woken up in time <b>for</b> the first day of school. You might think I’m <b>pretty</b> dumb for falling for that one, but I was <b>too</b> groggy to know any better and plus Rodrick had 
                    <em>SET</em> my clock ahead and pulled the blinds shut. So <b>I</b> just got up and got dressed and went downstairs <b>to</b> fix myself some breakfast. I must’ve made a big <b>racket</b> because the next thing I knew Dad was in <b>my</b> face wondering what the heck I was doing eating <b>Cheerios</b> at 3 am. The thing about Dad when he <b>comes</b> downstairs late at night is that he’s always just <b>wearing</b> a tee shirt and some boxer shorts. I don’t <b>know</b> which is worse, getting yelled out or having to <b>see</b> your father in his underwear. I keep meaning to 
                    <em>ASK</em> him to please put on some more clothes the <b>next</b> time he comes downstairs but the right opportunity never <b>comes</b> up. Anyway it took me a couple of minutes <b>to</b> figure out what all was going on. When I <b>told</b> Dad Rodrick tricked me Dad stomped on down to <b>Rodrick’s</b> room in the basement and I followed along. I <b>was</b> pretty excited to finally see Rodrick get what was <b>coming</b> to him. But when we got down there Rodrick <b>had</b> covered up his tracks pretty good and you would <b>never</b> know he had been up to something. Dad just 
                    <em>THREW</em> up his hands and went back up to bed. <b>So</b> now Dad thought I was an idiot AND a <b>liar.</b> Come to think of it ever since Dad has <b>been</b> real suspicious around me, like I’m turning into a <b>bad</b> kid or something. I’ll put it to you this <b>way...</b> if I’m going to do something bad and take <b>the</b> heat like I did that night you better believe <b>I’m</b> going to come up with something a lot more <b>satisfying</b> than eating a bowl of Cheerios in the middle <b>of</b> the night. Today in Social Studies I scored pretty
