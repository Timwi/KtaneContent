                        In the module, you will see an appointment indicated by
                    one of the four buttons and one of the characters in
                    Mario's book that shows the image of the character on
                    each one. Please, select the correct letters.
                    <br><br>
                    Next, the name of the badge is shown on the button. The image of the credential is shown on the screen where the estimate was first displayed. Please, select the correct name of the badge.
                Finally, four icon elements are displayed on the screen. Your four choices will be the name of the object in the game. Three of them are displayed on the screen. Choose an odd number to solve the module.
