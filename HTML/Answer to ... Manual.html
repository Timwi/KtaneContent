								<h2>On the Subject of The Answer to ...</h2>
								 <p class="flavour-text">You think you know the Answers to a lot of things? Well think again.</p>

								<p>This module shows a number pad with the numbers from 0 to 9, a Clear button, and a submit button.<br>To solve the module you need to get the Original index for that module, then looking at the indicator to the right of the display. <br> You need to modify it according to the light shown and the rule used to get the index required to get use the appropriate rule. Additionally there are 6 randomly generated LEDs in a braille format.<br> After obtaining the correct rule you need to go to through each of its steps to modify the answer to satisfy the KTaNE. </p>
								<h3>Step 1:</h3>
								<p>You must use the following equation to calculate the Original index for the module.</p>
								<p><strong>ORIGINAL INDEX</strong> = (batteries * battery holders) + (Lit * Unlit) + (Unique ports * port plates)</p>
								<h3>Step 2:</h3>
								<p>After obtaining the original index, you must modify the index to find the correct rule to be used, The Table below shows you the rules for the indicator colours to the right of the display.</p>

					<h2>Step 3: </h2>
					<p>After you have obtained the correct modified index, you need to find it in the table below with its corresponding Answer. <br><br> That answer however needs to be modified again but this time base on the rule or index used and its corresponding rules.</p>
