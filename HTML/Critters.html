                <h2>On the Subject of Critters</h2>
                <p class="flavour-text">At least these bugs are not game-breaking.</p>
                <p>The module displays an 8×8 grid of tiles, a taller tile to the right, and two wider tiles above. To solve the module, iterate the grid according to the procedure described below and toggle tiles accordingly. Pressing the tile on the right will submit your answer. Striking or pressing the tile labelled with the first letter of the colour used to determine the rules applied will reset the grid. Pressing the wide tile labelled ‘C’ will clear all tiles, setting their states to be inactive.</p>
                <p>The grid has two sets with 16 2×2s each. The main set is obtained by dividing the grid into a 4×4 array of 2×2 groups. The alternate set uses the corners of these 2×2s as its centers and the centers of the 2×2s as its corners. Some of these 2×2s will wrap around.</p>
                <p>In the following table, look up the colour of your tiles and execute the corresponding ruleset. The instructions will apply to each 2×2 in the set used, individually. Use the condition corresponding to the number of coloured (active) cells in the 2×2.</p>
