                    <ul>
                        <li>The screen at the top of the module cycles through 10 two-digit numbers. This sequence is the module’s <strong>seed</strong>, starting with the number in blue.</li>
                        <li>The module will generate a 4×4 maze, where each cell is represented by a bulb in its corresponding position on  the module.</li>
                        <li>Two of the bulbs will be lit. The white bulb represents your current position, while the colored bulb represents the goal. Use the bars on the sides of the grid to navigate to the goal without passing through a wall in the maze.</li>
                    </ul>
                    <h3>Determining the Walls of the Maze</h3>
                    <ul>
                        <li>The module generates its maze using a certain algorithm. The algorithm used is determined by the color of the non-white bulb.</li>
                        <li>When generating the maze, the algorithm at many points requires the use of random numbers. 
                        <ul>
                            <li>Place a “pointer” on the first number of the seed.</li>
                            <li><strong>Any</strong> time the algorithm requests a random number, a number <var>n</var> will be supplied. Modulo the number the pointer is on by <var>n</var> to obtain the number used for the calculation.</li>
                            <li>Then, move the pointer to the next number of the seed, which wraps around from the end to the beginning.</li>
                        </ul></li>
                    </ul>
                    <h3>Important things you probably shouldn’t forget</h3>
                    <ul>
                        <li>The edges of the 4×4 grid are <strong>not</strong> classified as “edges” in the following algorithms. You still cannot pass through them on the module.</li>
                        <li>All counting is <strong>zero-indexed</strong>: The first entry of a sequence is index 0, the second is index 1, the third is index 2, etc.</li>
                        <li>Unless stated otherwise, all edges begin in an impassable state.</li>
                    </ul>

                    <li>Begin with all edges in a <strong>passable</strong> state. All 16 cells are initially one “group”. Groups are always rectangular. A partition is a line which divides a group into two others. A partition’s direction is the way its line points.</li>

                            <li>If <var>G</var> is taller than it is wide, partition it <strong>horizontally</strong>.</li>

                    <li>Generate a random number with <var>n</var>= the number of ways <var>G</var> can be partitioned using the obtained direction. Count this many into the list of possible partitions in top-down and left-right order, and call this partition <var>P</var>.</li>
                    <li>Every edge along <var>P</var> becomes <strong>impassable</strong>, and the sections of <var>G</var> segmented by <var>P</var> become two new groups.</li>
