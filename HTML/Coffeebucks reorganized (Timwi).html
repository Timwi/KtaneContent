                <h2>On the Subject of Coffeebucks</h2>
                <p class="flavour-text">These millennials make some weird caffeinated combinations. On the plus side, this company pays its taxes...</p>

                <ul>
                    <li>The module consists of a staff noticeboard, a takeout coffee cup, a tip counter and a tablet.</li>
                    <li>To disarm the module, you must earn $10's worth of tips. The faster and more accurately you serve, the greater your tip.</li>
                </ul>
                <ul>
                    <li>Press the 'Next Customer' button on the tablet to receive a customer and start the tip countdown (from $9.99).</li>
                    <li>The customer will tell you their name. Select it from the tablet to write it onto their takeaway cup.</li>
                    <li>You may ask the customer to repeat their name once. Doing so will reduce your potential tip by $2. Selecting an incorrect name will reduce your potential tip by $5.</li>
                    <li>The colour of the customer's name will determine their quirk.</li>
                    <li>Serving a drink with an incorrect or more than one quirk selected will reduce your potential tip by $2.</li>
                    <li>Your minimum tip will always be $0.50, provided you serve a correct drink.</li>
                </ul>
                <ul>
                    <li>Once the customer has told you their name, their four preferences will briefly flash sequentially on the tablet.</li>
                    <li>The customer will have four preferences: sugar requirements, time of day, stress-level and size.</li>
                    <li>There are four potential options for each preference. These are italicised in the flavour text of the menu.</li>
                    <li>If you don't quite catch all of the customer's preferences, you may press the preference buttons to re-show them.</li>
                    <li>However, the customer will not thank you for not paying attention; the first repeated preference press will decrease your potential tip by $0.50. Each subsequent press will double the penalty.</li>
                </ul>
                <ul>
                    <li>Serve the customer their preferred drink by pressing its name, remembering to enable their desired quirk if necessary.</li>
                    <li>The customer's preferred drink will be the one which has the most characteristics in common with their preferences.</li>
                    <li>There may be more than one preferred drink for any given customer.</li>
                    <li>If you serve a correct drink, the remaining tip on the counter will be added to your tip total on the staff noticeboard.</li>
                    <li>If you serve an incorrect drink, the customer will leave without tipping and a strike will be incurred.</li>
                </ul>
