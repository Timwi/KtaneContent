                <p>This module presents an ordered deck of cards. Select the one and only invalid card by pressing the
                    mole icon.</p>
                <p>Note that the invalid card will be invalid on the previous card, the card after it will be invalid on
                    it, and the card after will be <strong>valid</strong> on the previous card.</p>
                <p>The first card is always valid.</p>

                <h3>Rules</h3>
                <p>A card is valid if and only if both of the following two conditions apply:</p>
                <ul>
                    <li>One of the following two rules, chosen at random per module:
                        <ul>
                            <li>It has a higher or equal rank than the previous card, or the previous card is a Jack,
                                Queen, or King.</li>
                            <li>It has a lower or equal rank than the previous card, or it is a Jack, Queen, or King.
                            </li>
                        </ul>
                    </li>
                    <li>One of the following four rules, chosen at random per module:
                        <ul>
                            <li>It has the same rank or suit as the previous, or the suit next in the sequence
                                Bullets, Orbs, Spades, Hearts, Clubs, Diamonds, Stars, Nuts.</li>
                            <li>It has the same rank or suit as the previous, or the suit next in the sequence
                                Bullets, Hearts, Stars, Orbs, Clubs, Nuts, Spades, Diamonds.</li>
                            <li>It has the same rank or suit as the previous, or the suit next in the sequence
                                Bullets, Diamonds, Spades, Nuts, Clubs, Orbs, Stars, Hearts.</li>
                            <li>It has the same rank or suit as the previous, or the suit next in the sequence
