                <h2>On the Subject of Zendo</h2>
                <p class="flavour-text">We all learn from our mistakes. Well, except the ones that explode.</p>

                <ul>
                    <li>This module has a hidden rule that must be determined through experimentation.</li>
                    <li>According to this rule, patterns of shapes placed on the grid are categorized as either valid or invalid.</li>
                    <li>Once you determine the rule, you must correctly categorize five challenge patterns to disarm the module.</li>
                    <li>You may refer to the next pages for a list of all possible rules.</li>
                </ul>

                <h4>Determining the rule</h4>

                <p>
                    The module starts in edit mode with an example of a valid pattern on its grid. The module
                    will never issue a strike until you press the “Ready” button.
                </p>
                <p>
                    To edit the grid, select a shape and color from the palette on the right of the module,
                    then touch the grid to draw that symbol. You can also press the display on the right to
                    erase symbols instead. Press the display twice to clear the entire grid.
                </p>
                <p>
                    As you edit the grid, the buttons below the grid will indicate the validity of the current
                    pattern. If the pattern is valid, the “Y” button will light up. Otherwise, the “N”
                    button will light up.
                </p>
                <p>
                    Additionally, you can press the “Y” button to show a random example of a valid pattern,
                    and the “N” button to show a random example of an invalid pattern.
                </p>

                <h4>Disarming the module</h4>
                <p>When you think you know the rule and are ready to disarm the module, press the “Ready” button to switch to challenge mode.</p>
                <p>The grid will display a pattern. If the pattern matches the rule, press “Y”, otherwise press “N”. Repeat until the module is disarmed.</p>
                <p>If you are unsure of the rule, you can press “Ready” again to safely return the module to edit mode.</p>
                <p>If you make a mistake, the module will strike and return to edit mode with a new rule.</p>
