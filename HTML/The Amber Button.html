                    <h2>On the Subject of The Amber Button</h2>
                    <p class="flavour-text">If this module has bugs, they’re the kind that’ve been preserved for millions of years.</p>

                    <p class="appendix-reference">See Appendix BSE for information on base 36 conversion.</p>

                    <p>This module presents a button labelled with a question mark and a display screen, which will cycle through a sequence of question marks — some of which are upside-down. Initially, the sequence that the module shows will be of length 4. Each of these strings of question marks represents the base 36 value of a character in the serial number, using six-digit binary. A right-side up question mark represents a 0, whereas an upside-down question mark represents a 1. After finding which four characters are being represented, you must now enter the two serial number characters <strong>which were not displayed, in six-digit binary.</strong> They may be entered in any order.</p>
                    
                    <p>Pressing and holding the button over a timer tick will rotate it by 180 degrees, whereas tapping the button will enter whatever is on its label. For example, if the button were upside down, tapping it would enter an upside-down question mark.</p>
