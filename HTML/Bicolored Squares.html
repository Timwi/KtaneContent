                <h2>On the Subject of Bicolored Squares</h2>
                <p class="flavour-text">There is chaos in order. A color in the patterns. Find it, and all will become clear.</p>
                <p class="appendix-reference" id="appendix-reference">See Appendix of <span class="link"><a href="Colored%20Squares.html">Colored Squares</a></span> for identifying modules in Colored Squares family.</p>
                <ul>
                    <li>There are 5 possible colors: Red, Yellow, Blue, Green, and Magenta. Initially, if the module doesn’t display four colors occurring exactly four times each with exactly 1 color missing, you are looking at a different module.</li>
                    <li>The grid displayed is known as the initial phase.</li>
                    <li>To start, press 2 squares of different color. Afterwards, every square will display one of two colors. From the initial phase, the first color you pressed represents a dot and the second color represents a dash. Note that these colors invert every time a button is pressed after pressing a button during this phase.</li>
                    <li>To solve the module, select every square correctly during the selection phase. Valid selections are ones where when selecting squares then clicking the final square the dot and dash states form a character in the serial number. Continue the process until the module is solved. Selected squares cannot be used again. If it is impossible to create any Morse letter, a strike will be recorded and the module will reset back to the initial phase.</li>
                </ul>
