                <h2>On the Subject of Temporal Sequence</h2>
                <p class="flavour-text">What time is it?</p>  
                <h3>What is time?</h3>
                <p>
                    This module features 4 colored LEDs, 2 buttons, a digital clock, and a small display that shows the current stage number.
                    The clock displays a random time between 00:00 and 23:59.
                    Once all other <a href="../More/Ignore Table.html#mod=temporalSequence">non-ignored modules</a> have been solved,
                    the clock reverts to its Original Time and is ready for solving.
                </p>
                <h3>When is time?</h3>
                <p>
                    Each time a non-ignored module is solved, the small display increases the stage number by 1, 
                    one LED blinks, and the digital clock advances by a random duration. If the time surpasses 23:59, it loops back to 00:00.
                    Use the Advanced Time and blinking LED to determine the Adjusted Time.
                </p>
                <h3>How to calculate time?</h3>
                <p>
                    To determine the Adjusted Time, record how much the clock has advanced. Then, refer to Table 1 to calculate the Adjusted Time.
                    If at any point you get a negative duration, eliminate the negative sign.
                    If the Adjusted Time exceeds 24 hours, subtract 24-hour increments until the time is less than 24 hours.
                </p>
                <h3>How to submit time?</h3>
                <p>
                    When the module is primed for solving, the clock reverts to its Original Time.
                    Use the Hour (H) and Minute (M) buttons to move the clock forward with the Adjusted Time.
                    So when your Adjusted Time is 120 minutes, or 2 hours, and the Original Time is 12:00, you set the clock to 14:00.
                    Press the clock to submit that time. Keep inputting the Adjusted Time from the set clock. If required, loop back to 00:00.
                    Continue this process until the module is solved.
