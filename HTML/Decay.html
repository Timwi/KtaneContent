                <h2>On the Subject of Decay</h2>
                <p class="flavour-text">Everything falls apart...</p>
                <p>The module displays 3 pressable symbols. In order to solve the module, press the symbols in the correct order. Any confusing terminology will be explained at the end of the manual.</p>
                <h3>Step 1: Over-Complicated Prime Factorisation</h3>
                <p class="flavour-text">...the numbers...</p>
                <h4>Step 1.1: Decrypting the display</h4>
                <p>The module displays 3 encrypted symbols. To decrypt each symbol individually, interpret the vertical bars as binary, where a vertical connected to the base is a 1 and a vertical disconnected from the base is a 0. Then add 2<sup>k</sup>-1 to this value, where k is the amount of vertical bars on the character. Interpret the three values as base-15 and convert it in its entirety to decimal. This number will be called n.</p>
                <h4>Step 1.2: Constructing the tree</h4>
                <p>Construct a tree consisting of nodes and branches. To construct the tree start with a node with [V<sub>p</sub>=0; V<sub>r</sub>=n]. For each unique prime factor P of V<sub>r</sub>, create a child node with [V<sub>p</sub>=P; V<sub>r</sub>=(V<sub>r,parent</sub>/P)+1]. Order the children in each node from lowest to highest V<sub>p</sub>. This function should be applied to each node with V<sub>r</sub> not being prime. This set of nodes will be called T</p>

                <h3>Step 2: Neural Network Bit Cascade</h3>
                <p class="flavour-text">...the module...</p>
                <h4>Step 2.1: Obtaining the binary</h4>
                <p>Before any other symbol has been pressed, the middle symbol can be pressed freely. Pressing this symbol will play a sequence of seven notes. This must be converted to a 7-digit sequence of binary. For each note evaluate the following: If the next note is higher than this one, return a 1, otherwise return a 0. For the last note, "the next note" refers to the first note. This set will be called B<sub>i</sub>. Create an empty set called B<sub>f</sub>. Then start with k being 1 and execute the following process: Take the first k digits of the B<sub>i</sub> (repeating B<sub>i</sub> where necessary), reverse it, and append it to B<sub>f</sub>. Change k to k+1 and repeat. This process should be repeated until you have the necessary amount of binary for upcoming steps. You can always generate more if needed. Any time a bit is requested from B<sub>f</sub>, take the first bit that has not been used already.</p>
                <h4>Step 2.2: Assigning the branches</h4>
                <p>Starting from the base node, go to each child in order. Then from this child, go to its children in order and repeat until you hit a node that has no children. Set [b<sub>parent</sub>=B<sub>f,requested</sub>]. If a node has all b<sub>child</sub> assigned, set [b<sub>parent</sub>=Σ(b<sub>child</sub>)%2]. Continue this process until all branches b are assigned.</p>
                <h4>Step 2.3: Backpropagating</h4>
                <p>Start at the base node and set [V<sub>b</sub>=1]. Then go to its children and set [V<sub>b</sub>=V<sub>b,parent</sub>⊻b<sub>parent</sub>]. Go down the entire tree using this process.</p>

                <h3>Step 3: Quantum Logic</h3>
                <p class="flavour-text">...and eventually...</p>
                <h4>Step 3.1: Obtaining the initial number sequence</h4>
                <p>Create a sequence S with [S<sub>1</sub>=Σ(V<sub>p</sub>); S<sub>2</sub>=Σ(V<sub>p</sub>*V<sub>b</sub>)]. While S<sub>last</sub> is not 0, append [S<sub>second-last</sub>⨬S<sub>last</sub>].</p>
                <h4>Step 3.2: Obtaining the fractions</h4>
                <p>Convert n to base b, where b=Length(S), and interpret every digit as an entry of a sequence S2. If S2 has an odd length, extend the sequence by prepending it with a 0. Then for each k set [S2<sub>k</sub>=S<sub>S2<sub>k</sub>+1</sub>]. Group these numbers in pairs and turn them into fractions as low/high. 0/0 should be turned into 1/2. The set of fractions will be called F.</p>
                <h4>Step 3.3: Making the truth table</h4>
                <p>Before you can apply logic you must make a truth table. For this truth table request 2<sup>Length(F)</sup> bits from B<sub>f</sub>. Each bit will refer to a unique combination of 1's and 0's with a length equal to Length(F). The binary configurations should be ordered from low to high when interpreted as a number and then be connected to the requested bit. Call this truth table TT.</p>
                <h4>Step 3.4: Applying the quantum logic</h4>
                <p>Start with f=0. For each k where TT<sub>k,truth</sub>=1, apply the following: For each p, if TT<sub>k,p</sub>=0, temporarily set [F<sub>p</sub>=1-F<sub>p</sub>]. Then set [f=f+Π(F)] and change the temporarily changed values back. f should be kept as a fraction at all times.</p>

                <h3>Step 4: Submission</h3>
                <p class="flavour-text">...your sanity.</p>
                <h4>Step 4.1: Obtaining the submission sequence</h4>
                <p>Create an empty sequence S3. Add ⌊f⌋ to S3 and then set [f=1/(f%1)]. Repeat until the numerator is 0.</p>
                <h4>Step 4.2: Submitting the answer</h4>
                <p>To submit S3, convert each value to binary. Enter the digits in these numbers from most to least significant using the left symbol for 0 and the right symbol for 1. The middle symbol is used to enter the current entry of the sequence. Pressing the middle symbol twice consecutively will submit the inputted sequence.</p>
