                    I want to major in anything that takes this combination of classes together.

                <ul>
                    <li>You have been lazy through your summer vacation, so taking classes quickly became a matter of life and death - literally.
                    <li>On the bomb there is a grid for your schedule, buttons for the five classes you have to take, and a SUBMIT button.
                    <li>The class pairs (shown as columns in the next table) are always on the same button.
                    <li>However, the locations of the buttons are randomized. You should use the first letter of each class to determine which button is which.
                    <li>There is only one class you should be taking in each pair, decided by the following table. (If the character is a letter, simply convert it to its numeric value, A=1, B=2 etc.)
                </ul>
                <table class="curriculum">

                <ul>
                    <li>Now that you know which classes to take, you should decide which section of that class you should take.
                    <li>Each class has 3 different sections that are available, each of which has 2-3 lectures throughout the week. Each lecture is shown as a white cell on the grid.
                    <li>Whenever sections of two different classes try to have a lecture on the same slot, it will result in a <u>conflict</u>. These will show up on your schedule marked as red.
                    <li>By default, a proper schedule that you can submit should have <b>zero</b> conflicts.
                    <li>There are also <u>special conditions</u>, and <b>only one of them</b> is effective for your module.
                    <li>Follow the table on the next page to find which condition suits your bomb. Start from the top and whenever you find a fitting condition, <b>stop</b>. Your schedule should accomodate the effects of that condition.
