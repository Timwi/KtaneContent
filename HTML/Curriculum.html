                    <li>On the bomb there is a grid for your schedule, buttons for the five classes you have to take, and a SUBMIT button.
                    <li>Take the first five characters of the serial number into consideration for the next table. (If the character is a letter, simply convert it to its numeric value, A=1, B=2 etc.)

                    <li>Each class has 3 different sections that is available, each of which has 2-3 lectures throughout the week. Each lecture is shown as a white cell on the grid.
                    <li>Whenever sections of two different classes try to have a lecture on the same slot, it will result in a <u>conflict</u>. These will show up on your schedule marked as red.
                    <li>By default, a proper schedule that you can submit should have <em>zero</em> conflicts.
                    <li>There are also conditions which may or may not affect your schedule:
