                <p class="flavour-text">
                    By barking with text-to-speech on, the dog accidentally programmed a module.
                </p>
                <ul>
                    <li>Input the correct letter sequence determined using the following instructions.
                    <li>An incorrect input resets the module and gives a strike.
                </ul>
                <h3>Step 1: Figuring the starting sequence</h3>
                <ul>
                    <li>
                        Follow these rules in the order they are listed. Select the first sequence that applies:
                        <ol>
                            <li>If there are at least 3 lit indicators on the bomb, the starting sequence is "UNDERTALE".</li>
                            <li>Otherwise, if there are at least 3 unlit indicators on the bomb, the starting sequence is "DELTARUNE".</li>
                            <li>Otherwise, if there are exactly 8 solved modules, the starting sequence is "NUDE ALERT".</li>
                            <li>Otherwise, if there are less than 6 modules on the bomb, the starting sequence is "ANT DUELER".</li>
                            <li>Otherwise, if there is 1 minute left or less, or if there is more than 1 needy module on the bomb, the starting sequence is "ULTRA NEED".</li>
                            <li>Otherwise, if the initial time on the bomb was 10 minutes or more, the starting sequence is "ELDER AUNT".</li>
                            <li>Otherwise, if there are at least 3 circular jacks (a Stereo RCA has 2, a Component Video has 3, etc.), the starting sequence is "NUT LEADER".</li>
                            <li>Otherwise, if the serial number has an E or a D, the starting sequence is "NEUTRAL ED".</li>
                            <li>If none of the above apply, the starting sequence is "UNRELATED".</li>
                        </ol>
                    </li>
                </ul>
                <h3>Step 2: Permuting the sequence</h3>
                <ul>
                    <li>For each AA battery on the bomb, put the last letter of the sequence before the others.</li>
                    <li>For each D battery on the bomb, put the first letter of the sequence after the others.</li>
                    <li>If the total number of ports is odd (count a Stereo RCA, a Component Video, etc. as 1 port each), reverse the sequence.</li>
                    <li>Enter the resulting sequence on the keypad.</li>
                </ul>
                <p><strong><em>However,</em></strong> if there is an unlit indicator with label BOB and the serial number has 2 letters that are present on the module, skip the steps 1 and 2 altogether and input "UNRELATED" instead.</p>
