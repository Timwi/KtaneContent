                <p class="flavour-text">What do the numbers and letters mean, Charlie?!</p>

                <p>The module consists of three main parts: a 4&times;4 grid of circular buttons each lit up in one of five possible colors: white, red, yellow, green, or blue; a set of 16 square alphanumeric labels surrounding the grid of buttons; and a large button (&ldquo;Enter Key&rdquo;) above the grid labeled with one of the following: &ldquo;end&rdquo;, &ldquo;done&rdquo;, &ldquo;test&rdquo;, &ldquo;check&rdquo;, &ldquo;enter&rdquo;, &ldquo;ready&rdquo;, &ldquo;defuse&rdquo;, &ldquo;finish&rdquo;, &ldquo;submit&rdquo;, &ldquo;verify&rdquo;, &ldquo;transmit&rdquo;, or &ldquo;deactivate.&rdquo;</p>
                <p>Press anything that is only <strong>one</strong> of a:</p>
                <ol>
                    <li>white button that is <strong>exactly</strong> a Manhattan distance of 3 away from a B, M, Q, S, or X;</li>
                    <li>red button that is a knight&rsquo;s move away from a K, N, I, G, H, or T;</li>
                    <li>yellow button directly next to another blue button, not including diagonals (unless its row or column contains a label whose contents are included in the bomb&rsquo;s serial number, in which case <strong>only</strong> diagonals count);</li>
                    <li>green button on a row without any other green buttons nor an even number;</li>
                    <li>red button whose right, bottom, and bottom-right neighbors form the colors of the Windows XP logo (i.e. green, blue, and yellow, respectively);</li>
                    <li>blue button whose row and column have at least 3 labels containing a digit;</li>
                    <li>white button on a column labeled with an even number (unless the Enter Key has a label that is 5 letters or shorter, then replace &ldquo;even&rdquo; with &ldquo;odd&rdquo;);</li>
                    <li>red button that diagonally neighbors a label with a letter included in the bomb&rsquo;s serial number;</li>
                    <li>green button not on the same row or column as a letter that is not one of A, E, I, O, or U (unless the Enter Key has a label containing the letter D, in which case replace &ldquo;green&rdquo; with &ldquo;yellow&rdquo;);</li>
                    <li>yellow button on the same row or column as one or more of L, N, R, S, or T, but not on the same row or column as one E or more;</li>
                    <li>green button on the same row or column as <strong>exactly</strong> one letter whose Morse Code representation takes an equal number of time units as the letter S;</li>
                    <li>blue button whose row contains a letter and the number it represents in a phone number (e.g. one label that says 2 and another that says one of A, B, or C);</li>
                </ol>

                <ol start="13">
                    <li>white button whose column contains a letter and the number it represents in a phone number (e.g. one label that says 2 and another that says one of A, B, or C);</li>
                    <li>red button on the same row or column as a digit or letter whose ASCII code point is a prime number;</li>
                    <li>yellow button that orthogonally borders a label containing a letter with the same shape as a Greek letter (A, B, E, H, I, K, M, N, O, P, T, X, Y, or Z);</li>
                    <li>green button on the same row or column as both the letter O and the digit 0, or both the letter I and the digit 1, but not both of these pairs;</li>
                    <li>yellow button that orthogonally borders both a blue button and a label that says one of the letters on the Enter Key (unless the Enter Key has an even number of characters, in which case replace &ldquo;yellow&rdquo; with &ldquo;green&rdquo; and &ldquo;blue&rdquo; with &ldquo;red&rdquo;);</li>
                    <li>blue button that is <em>at least</em> a Manhattan distance of 4 away from a label with a letter that is not one of A, E, I, O, or U (unless at least 3 labels on the module have letters or digits included in the bomb&rsquo;s serial number, in which case Y is also excluded);</li>
                    <li>white button on the same diagonal as exactly two digits that share no common divisors;</li>
                    <li>red button on the same diagonal as <em>exactly</em> one of the digits 8, 6, 7, 5, 3, 0, or 9 (unless the bomb&rsquo;s serial number contains <em>at least</em> one of those digits, in which case ignore this rule altogether);</li>
                    <li>yellow button on the same column as an R and on the same row as one or more of S, D, or G;</li>
                    <li>green button on the same row as an R or an F, and on the same column as a C or a P (unless the Enter Key is labeled with a word with only one type of vowel letter, in which case also apply the rule to white and blue buttons);</li>
                    <li>blue button without any other white button on the same row nor on the same column;</li>
                    <li>or white button on the same diagonal as a label that matches either the initial or the number of letters in the name of a Teenage Mutant Ninja Turtle (i.e. 7, 8, 9, D, L, M, or R),</li>
                </ol>
                <p>then finally press the Enter Key.</p>
                <p>Pressing a button that fulfills less or more than <strong>one</strong> of these conditions, pressing the same button more than once, or pressing the Enter Key before all the necessary buttons have been pressed will invoke a strike.</p>
