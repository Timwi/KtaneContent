                <h2>On the Subject of Simon Sings</h2>
                <p class="flavour-text">
                    Never gonna sing in tune, never gonna flash maroon, never gonna call up Simon and show up.
                    Never gonna seal your fate, never gonna detonate, never gonna solve your modules and blow up.</p>

                <ul>
                    <li>This module consists of a round piano board with colored keys. There is also a light in the center of the module that flashes the colors of some of the keys.</li>
                    <li>The light cycles through a sequence of 8 colors. Black indicates a space between repetitions. Identify which piano keys have these colors and translate them to binary digits according to Table 1 below. If the condition in the table is true, the digit is a 1; otherwise, a 0. Each group of 4 constitutes one 4-digit binary number.</li>
                    <li>The module consists of three stages. In each stage, the two binary numbers point to two new piano keys to press according to Table 2. In each stage, press the keys from the previous stages plus the new ones.</li>
                    <li>The keyboard has two octaves, one on the left half of the wheel and the other on the right. Each key to press is on the other side from the previous. Start on the left if the serial number has a vowel and on the right otherwise.</li>
                    <li>A strike will reset the input for the current stage. Long-press the light in the center to reset the entire module (only available in stages 2–3).</li>
                </ul>
