                <ul>
                    <li>The module shows a stage counter, a colour indicator and ten flashing lights with corresponding buttons.</li>
                    <li>The lights will flash in one of ten colours (see the below table). An initial will confirm the colour for both the light and the colour indicator.</li>
                    <li>On solving each <a href="../More/Ignore Table.html#mod=simonsStages">non-ignored module</a>, a 3–5 note sequence will flash, a colour will be displayed on the indicator and the solve counter will increase by one.</li>
                    <li><span class='bold'>Take note of the sequence and the colour of the indicator.</span></li>
                    <li>When <cite>Simon’s Stages</cite> is the last solvable module, the solve counter will go blank and the indicator will emit a steady blink.</li>
                    <li><span class='bold'>The module is now ready to be solved. Attempting to press any button before the module is ready to be solved will cause a strike.</span></li>
