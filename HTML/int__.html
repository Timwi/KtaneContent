                <p>The string of numbers in the screen represents a <em>program</em> — a series of
                    instructions — that computes a string of three digits 0–9. Trace the execution
                    of the program (starting with the instruction on the far left) to obtain the
                    three digits computed, then use the instruction buttons to enter the result.</p>

                <h3>Instructions</h3>
                <p>The three digits start out at 0. There is also a <em>pointer</em> pointing at one of the
                    digits which initially points at the first.</p>
                <p>There is also a “state” value which is initially 0.</p>

                <h3>Input</h3>
                <p>During input, there is a <em>pointer</em> pointing at three input digits.
                    The digits start out at 0, and the pointer initially points at the leftmost digit.</p>
                <p>Using the button on the right, switch between the various commands. Use the button
                    on the left to execute the command shown on it.</p>
                <p>Use the '{' command to start your input.</p>
                <p>Use the '+' and '-' instructions to move the <em>pointer</em> between digits.</p>
                <p>Use the '&lt;' and '&gt;' instructions to increment or decrement the current digit (modulo 10).</p>
                <p>The ',' or '.' command can be used to set all three digits back to 0.</p>
                <p>If the '.' command is used, the '{' command must be used again to start input.</p>
                <p>Use the '}' command to submit your input.</p>
                <p>If the submitted answer is incorrect, the input digits are reverted to 0,
                    the <em>pointer</em> is moved back to the first digit, and the
                    '{' command must be used again to begin input.</p>
