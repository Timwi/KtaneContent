                <p>The module consists of a jukebox with three lyrics and three vinyl buttons.</p>
                <p>Use the given lyrics to work out which song has been selected.</p>
                <p>Enter the song lyrics in the order they appear in the song.</p>
                <p>Certain words may appear in multiple songs, but all three will only appear in any one song.</p>
                <p>If a word appears more than once in a song, use the first instance of its usage.</p>
