                    <p>This module has bean sprouts on it. Some sprouts have a bean on either the left or right side. Additionally, each sprout can be raw, cooked or burnt. To solve the module, you must consume three valid sprouts (but no more). Eating an incorrect bean will cause a strike. If no valid beans are present, the module will not strike you for eating a different one. Eating more than three beans will also cause a strike but the module will stay solved. <em><strong>Note that you cannot see a sprout when it has been eaten.</strong></em></p>

                    <h3>Finding Valid Sprouts</h3>
                    
                    <p>To find out if a bean is valid or invalid, plug all of the bean's information into the table below. This will tell you whether or not the bean is valid. Consume the first valid bean from top to bottom.</p>
