                <h2>On the Subject of Space</h2>
                <p class="flavour-text">"Who are we? We find that we live on an insignificant planet of a humdrum star lost in a galaxy tucked away in some forgotten corner of a universe in which there are far more galaxies than people." - Carl Sagan</p>
                <p class="flavour-text">"SPAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAACE" - Space Sphere</p>

                <p>The module has a space bar on a background of space.</p>
                <p>Using the specific image of space, find a space-related quote in the table below.</p>
                <p>Press the space bar to begin. Upon doing so, the module will begin to go through the quote, ignoring punctuation, at a speed of one character per tick of the bomb's timer. Press the space bar on each space in the quote.</p>
                <p>All quotes are appended with a space. Treat words separated by a dash or a slash as two words i.e. separated by a space.</p>
