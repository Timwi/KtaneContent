                        <h2>On the Subject of the Faulty Sink</h2>
                        <p class="flavour-text">There's nothing worse than when your plumbing is not working properly.</p>
						
						<p>In the process of transferring manufacturers for our Sinks, there have been some issues in production, causing many of our product to become faulty.<br> While this issue would generally be dealt with within our own parties, it appears that many of these faulty Sinks have made their way to the general public, and it is our reponsibility to request a recall of this product for general safety and performance.<br>
						Unfortunately, as this product is designed with explosives in mind, it's important to know how to dismantle the product before removal and return of the product.<br>
						Fortunately, we have documentation of the workings of the various faulty product. Use the following instructions along with the original <a href="http://ktane.timwi.de/HTML/Sink.html">Sink</a> instructions as a guide. Do not interact with a hot or cold knob unless the instructions state that you may.<br>
						<br>
						<b>Important:</b> The most common malfunction is an endless turning knob. If you interact with a button one of the knobs may begin spinning on its own. The knob will continue spinning until it is manually stopped.<br>
						There are three different ways to stop a knob from spinning:<br>
						<ol>
						<li>If the knob begins spinning after turning three correct knobs, select those three knobs in reverse.</li>
						<li>Otherwise if a knob is spinning clockwise, hold that knob for three seconds and let go. If you hold for longer than five seconds, you may recieve a warning.</li>
						<li>Otherwise, if the knob is spinning counter-clockwise, select the opposite knob.</li>
						</ol>
						<li>If only the drain pipe appears black, select the hot knob and then select the sink itself.</li>
						<li>If the drain pipe appears blue, swap all cold and hot knob inputs</li>
						<li>If there are pink textures, select the texture from another object on the module and copy it over the pink texture. When the knobs are the same, you may interact with them.</li>
						<li>If all materials are black, the product is overheating. Do not interact with the hot knob. You may use the faucet or drain pipe instead. The cold knob will function as normal.</li>
						<li>If the module is upside down, that means the product is working in reverse. Renumber the intended conditionals from bottom to top [1-6], and check the number of batteries from bottom [0-1] to top [6+]. Finally, input the final knob inputs in reverse.</li>
