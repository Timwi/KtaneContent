                <h2>On the Subject of Cube Synchronization</h2>
                <p class="flavour-text">Don’t forget the perspectives this time!</p>
                <p>
                    When the bomb is started, the defuser will see a white square with a green number (top-right) on the module.
                    Every time a <a href="../More/Ignore%20Table.html#mod=qkCubeSynchronization">non-ignored module</a> is solved, a blue number (top-left),
                    a red number (bottom-right) and a black arrow will display on each Cube Synchronization module X times (see appendix X) periodically,
                    one at a time, going from lowest to highest (green number), looping around.<br>
                    The white square might start turning as well.
                </p>
                <p>
                    Each of these flashes represent a side of a face on a cube.<br>
                    When a new module is solved during the display phase, the new faces will display after the faces of the current stage.<br>
                    Consider this cube net with empty faces:
                </p>
                <img src="img/Cube Synchronization/CubeNet.png">
                <p>
                    <b>On each stage:</b><br>
                    Aquire the information of all the sides (turn direction as well, if the square was turning) (Might not fill the whole cube!) <br>
                    The red number represents the position of the face in the cube net above (1-6).<br>
                    On the back (inner) side, write the given movements (arrow and turn) and the blue number multiplied by the green number of the module the face was displayed on. <br>
                    On the front (outer) side, write the opposite of the given movements and the blue number multiplied by: <br>
                </p>
                <ul>
                    <li>If Twitch Plays is active, the ID of the module on Twitch Plays</li>
                    <li>Otherwise the green number + 2</li>
                </ul>
                <p>
                    If every face on the cube is filled, but there are still faces left, start a new cube! (Always start a new cube for a new stage!)<br>
                    On each of the cubes you’ve got, close the net and look at it so you’re facing the front side of face 4 and face 6 is on top (whether they are present or not)!

                    Take the number of solved, non-ignored modules (aka. the number of the stage you’re currently on)!<br>
                    Modulo it by 20!<br>
                    Take:
                </p>
                <ul>
                    <li>If both Twitch Plays and Tweaks are present: The sum of the Points Per Module scores (Twitch Plays and Time Mode)</li>
                    <li>If only Twitch Plays is present: Twitch Plays Points Per Module score of this module</li>
                    <li>If only Tweaks is present: Time Mode Points Per Module score of this module</li>
                    <li>Otherwise (or if the above instructions yield 0 or less): 3</li>
                </ul>
                <p>
                    To acquire the scores, see appendix S!<br>
                    Multiply these two numbers together (round them <b>up</b> to the nearest integer)!<br>
                    Repeat that many number of times on all cubes:<br>
                </p>
                <ul>
                    <li>If that face was turning, turn the cube in the turn direction you’re currently facing (The direction of the arrows won't change!)</li>
                    <li>Rotate the cube in the direction on the face you’re currently facing (If a face is not filled, you’re facing the back side of the opposite face, if you see no face at all, rotate it downwards)!</li>
                </ul>
                <p>
                    Join together the numbers (Do not sum them!) you see on the cubes that you’ve written on them before (If you see no number, add 30)!<br>
                    When the modules are ready to be solved, input [All of the numbers you’ve got joined, add the green number at the end (The green numbers will disappear when it’s ready to be solved!)]<br>
                    On an incorrect digit, a strike will be issued. Upon a strike, a yellow button will show up. Pressing said button will show the cube the defuser is currently inputting (the same way it was shown the first time).<br>
                    Once every correct digit is entered, the module will solve.

                    To acquire scores, see appendix S!<br>
                    Round the number <b>up</b> to the nearest integer, modulo it by 10!<br>
                    The number you’ve got is X. (This many faces will appear <b>on each</b> Cube Synchronization module per stage)
                </p>
                <p>Note: Calculating X isn’t necessary as it will be the same for each stage, and they appear periodically on the modules.</p>
