                <h2>On the Subject of Cube Synchronization</h2>
                <p class="flavour-text">Don't forget the perspectives this time!</p>
                When the bomb is started, the defuser will see a white square with a green number (top-right) on the module. Every time a non-ignored module is solved, a blue number (top-left), a red number (bottom-right) and a black arrow will display on each Cube Synchronization modules X times (see appendix X) periodically, one at a time, going from lowest to highest (green number), looping around.
                <br> The white square might start turning as well.
                <br>Each of these flashes represent a side of a face on a cube.
                <br>When a new module is solved during the display phase, the new faces will display after the faces of the current stage.
                <br> Consider this cube net with empty faces:<br><img src="img/Cube Synchronization/CubeNet.png" />
                <div style="height: 6mm"></div>
                <strong>On each stage: </strong>
                <div style="height: 6mm"></div>
                Aquire the information of all the sides (turn direction as well, if the square was turning) (Might not fill the whole cube!) <br>
                The red number represents the position of the face in the cube net above (1-6).<br>
                On the back (inner) side, write the given movements (arrow and turn) and the blue number multiplied by the green number of the module the face was displayed on. <br>
                On the front (outer) side, write the opposite of the given movements and the blue number multiplied by: <br>
                <ul class="outer">
                    <li>If Twitch Plays is active, the ID of the module on Twitch Plays</li>
                    <li>Otherwise the green number + 2</li>
                </ul><br>
                If every face on the cube is filled, but there are still faces left, start a new cube! (Always start a new cube for a new stage!)<br>
                On each of the cubes you've got, close the net and look at it so you're facing the front side of face 4 and face 6 is on top (whether they are present or not)!

                Take the number of solved, non-ignored modules (aka. the number of the stage you're currently on)!<br>
                Modulo it by 20!<br>
                Take:<br>
                <ul class="outer">
                    <li>If both Twitch Plays and Tweaks are present: The sum of the Points Per Module scores (Twitch Plays and Time Mode)</li>
                    <li>If only Twitch Plays is present: Twitch Plays Points Per Module score of this module</li>
                    <li>If only Tweaks is present: Time Mode Points Per Module score of this module</li>
                    <li>Otherwise (or if the above instructions yield 0 or less): 3</li>
                </ul><br>
                To acquire the scores, see appendix S!<br>
                Multiply these two numbers together (round them <strong>up</strong> to the nearest integer)!<br>
                Repeat that many number of times on all cubes:<br>
                <ul class="outer">
                    <li>If that face was turning, turn the cube in the turn direction you're currently facing (The direction of the arrows won't change!)</li>
                    <li>Rotate the cube in the direction on the face you're currently facing (If a face is not filled, you're facing the back side of the opposite face, if you see no face at all, rotate it downwards)!</li>
                </ul><br>
                Join together the numbers (Do not sum them!) you see on the cubes that you've written on them before (If you see no number, add 30)!<br>
                When the modules are ready to be solved, input [All of the numbers you've got joined, add the green number at the end (The green numbers will disappear when it's ready to be solved!)]<br>
                On an incorrect digit, a strike will be issued. Upon a strike, a yellow button will show up. Pressing said button will show the cube the defuser is currently inputting (the same way it was shown the first time).<br>
                Once every correct digit is entered, the module will solve.

                Round the number <strong>up</strong> to the nearest integer, modulo it by 10!<br>
                The number you've got is X. (This many faces will appear <strong>on each</strong> Cube Synchronization module per stage)

                Note: Calculating X isn't necessary as it will be the same for each stage, and they appear periodically on the modules.
