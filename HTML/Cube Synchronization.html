                <h2>On the Subject of Cube Synchronization</h2>
                <p class="flavour-text">Don't forget the perspectives this time!</p>
				When the bomb is started, the defuser will see a white square with a green number (top-right) on the module. Every time a non-ignored module is solved, a blue number (top-left), a red number (bottom-right) and a black arrow will display on each Cube Synchronization modules X times (see appendix X) periodically, one at a time, going from lowest to highest (green number), looping around.
				<br> The white square might start turning as well.
				<br>Each of these flashes represent a side of a face on a cube.
				<br>When a new module is solved during the display phase, the new faces will display after the faces of the current stage.
				<br> Consider this cube net with empty faces:<br><img src="img/Cube Synchronization/CubeNet.png" /><br><br>
				<strong>On each stage: </strong><br><br>
				Aquire the information of all the sides (turn direction as well, if the square was turning) (Might not fill the whole cube! <br>
				The red number represents the position of the face in the cube net above (1-6).<br>
				On the front (outer) side, write the given movements (arrow and turn) and the blue number multiplied by the green number of the module the face was displayed on. <br>
				On the back (inner) side, write the opposite of the given movements and the blue number multiplied by: <br>
				<ul class="outer">
					<li>If Twitch Plays is active, the ID of the module on Twitch Plays</li>
					<li>Otherwise the green number + 2</li>
				</ul><br>
				If every face on the cube is filled, but there are still faces left, start a new cube! (Always start a new cube for a new stage!)<br>
				On each of the cubes you've got, close the net and look at it so you're facing the front side of face 4 and face 6 is on top!

                Take the number of solved, non-ignored modules (aka. the number of the stage you're currently on)!<br>
                Modulo it by 20!<br>
                Take:<br>
                <ul class="outer">
					<li>If both Twitch Plays and Tweaks are present: The sum of the Points Per Module scores (Twitch Plays and Time Mode)</li>
					<li>If only Twitch Plays is present: Twitch Plays Points Per Module score of this module</li>
					<li>If only Tweaks is present: Time Mode Points Per Module score of this module</li>
					<li>Otherwise (or if the above instructions yield 0 or less): 3</li>
                </ul><br>
                To acquire the scores, see appendix S!<br>
                Multiply these two numbers together (round them <strong>up</strong> to the nearest integer)!<br>
                Repeat that many number of times on all cubes:<br>
                <ul class="outer">
					<li>If that face was turning, turn the cube in the turn direction you're currently facing (The direction of the arrows won't change!)</li>
					<li>Rotate the cube in the direction on the face you're currently facing (If a face is not filled, you're facing the back side of the opposite face, if you see no face at all, rotate it downwards)!</li>
                </ul><br>
                Add together the numbers you see on the cubes that you've written on them before (If you see no number, add 30)!<br>
                When the modules are ready to be solved, input [sum of each number you've got + green number on the module (The green numbers will disappear when it's ready to be solved!)]<br>
                On an incorrect digit, a strike will be issued.<br>
                Once every correct digit is entered, the module will solve.

				<h2>Appendix X</h2>
				To calculate X:<br>
				Take:<br>
				<ul class="outer">
					<li>If both Twitch Plays and Tweaks are present: The sum of the Base scores (Twitch Plays and Time Mode)</li>
					<li>If only Twitch Plays is present: Twitch Plays Base score of this module</li>

					<li>Otherwise (or if the above instructions yield 0 or less): 4</li>
				</ul><br>
				To acquire scores, see appendix S!<br>
				Round the number <strong>up</strong> to the nearest integer, modulo it by 10!<br>
				The number you've got is X. (This many faces will appear <strong>on each</strong> Cube Synchronization module per stage)<br></br>
				Note: Calculating X isn't necessary as it will be the same for each stage, and they appear periodically on the modules.<br><br>
				<h2>Appendix S</h2>
				To acquire Twitch Plays scores, run <strong>!read module score Cube Synchronization</strong><br><br>
				Tweaks (Time Mode scores) can be acquired on <a target="_blank" href="https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/16lz2mCqRWxq__qnamgvlD0XwTuva4jIDW1VPWX49hzM/edit?usp=sharing">this sheet</a>. Priorities (column names):<br>
				<ol class="outer">
					<li>Assigned</li>
					<li>Community</li>
					<li>TP</li>
					<li>Score</li>
				</ol><br><br>
				If a score is not present (or there's no internet connection), count it as 0!
