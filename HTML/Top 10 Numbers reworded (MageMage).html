                    Top 10 Numbers has two displays, and 10 buttons from 1 through 10. While doing the module, you will
                    create a list of numbers each entry being between 1 and 10.<br>
                    After every <a href="../More/Ignore%20Table.html#mod=top10nums">non-ignored solve</a>, and at the start of the
                    bomb, the module will update both displays. The left display showing the stage, ticking down from the
                    amount of unignored modules, and the right is that <strong>stage's number</strong>.
                    For every stage you will append exactly one number to the answer list.
                </p>
                <p>
                    To begin create a list of the numbers 1 through 10 in order, this will be called the <strong>number priority list</strong>, additionally no number is disliked at this state.<br>
                    For each stage, reference the corresponding section based on the color of the stage number and procede there:
                </p>
                <h3>Stage number is BLUE</h3>
                <p>Take the stage number and find that position in the number priority list. The number you find there will be the answer for this stage <strong>UNLESS</strong> said number is disliked.</p>
                <p>If you are supposed to add a disliked number, instead move towards the start of the priority list one number at a time until you either hit a number that isn't disliked or you arrive at the start of the list, the number you arrive on will be added instead.</p>
                <p>After having added a number, move it from its current position to the end of the priority list into position 10, shifting all other numbers to fill in the gaps.</p>

                <h3>Stage number is RED</h3>
                <p>Before finding this stages answer you need to determine numbers to dislike:</p>
                <ul>
                    <li>First, if you had disliked numbers before, they are no longer disliked</li>
                    <li>Then, reference the stage number in the table below to obtain 1 or 2 letters</li>
                    <li>These letters refer to rules below the table, each rule giving one number to be disliked (2 rules may give the same number)</li>
                </ul>
                <table>
                    <tr><th>1</th><th>2</th><th>3</th><th>4</th><th>5</th><th>6</th><th>7</th><th>8</th><th>9</th><th>10</th></tr>
                    <tr><th>D</th><th>C</th><th>C & D</th><th>B</th><th>B & D</th><th>B & C</th><th>A</th><th>A & D</th><th>A & C</th><th>A & B</th></tr>
                </table>
                <ul>
                    <li><strong>A)</strong> The <strong>answer</strong> of the previous stage.</li>
                    <li><strong>B)</strong> The first number in number priority.</li>
                    <li><strong>C)</strong> The least common <strong>answer</strong>, ties broken by the latest in number priority.</li>
                    <li><strong>D)</strong> The most common <strong>answer</strong>, ties broken by the earliest in number priority.</li>
                </ul>
                <p>After determining the number(s) to dislike, the answer for this stage is the number at position 1 in number priority. Move it to the back as you would for a blue stage number.</p>

                <p>Once you have every <strong>answer</strong>, input them all in the order you obtained them by
                    pressing the corresponding button. Upon a strike, the module will re-display the corresponding <strong>stage number</strong></p>
