                            A grid on this module with 4 by 4 squares<br>
                            shows images, letters and other affairs.<br>
                            The goal’s to decode what the cell values mean;<br>
                            then solve a Sudoku to turn the light green.<br>
                            The answers are also submitted in code.<br>
                            Just get them all right and you will not explode.
                        </p>
                        <p>
                            All letter-based codes translate numbers the same:<br>
                            The serial’s first letter is number 1’s “name”.<br>
                            Now take the first digit — treat 0 as 10 —<br>
                            jump that many steps through the alphabet. Then<br>
                            that’s the new “name” for the 2. Then jump more<br>
                            the same amount, getting to “name” 3 and 4.<br>
                            Of course, at the end of the alphabet, you<br>
                            must wrap to the start as you usually do.<br>
                            These “names” affect Morse Code and Tap Code and Braille<br>
                            and Maritime Flags and they also entail<br>
                            the Semaphores, Zoni, and then in addition,<br>
                            in Binary their alphabetic position.<br>
                            When Maritime, Zoni and Morse are pre-filled,<br>
                            a number instead may be shown. Don’t get killed!
                        </p>
                        <p>
                            But that is not all of the codes. There are more!<br>
                            Each instance that follows shows 1, 2, 3, 4.<br>
                            Kick, snare, hi-hat, open: the samples of Simon’s.<br>
                            The card suits are spades, hearts and clubs and then diamonds.<br>
                        </p>

                            The Snooker ball colors: red, yellow, green, brown.<br>
                            The arrows go clockwise beginning with “down”.<br>
                            Mahjong tiles: Plum, Orchid, Chrysanthemum, Bamboo.<br>
                            The chess pieces: rook, knight, then bishop, queen, too.<br>
                            Astrology: fire, then water, earth, air,<br>
                            concluding the list. These are all that are there.

                        <p>
                            To input an answer, just tap on a square.<br>
                            A sound may be heard or a symbol shown there<br>
                            or sometimes, a panel may open instead<br>
                            or maybe the square will turn blue or dark red.<br>
                            The panel wants Braille, Letters or Semaphores,<br>
                            while blue means “use Tap Code” and red means “use Morse”.<br>
                            Refer to its manual for Tap Code’s mechanics,<br>
                            while Morse Code is entered the same as Morsematics.<br>
                            For symbols and sounds, just re-tap till it fits;<br>
                            then two seconds later, your input submits.<br>
                            An arrow reveals itself rapidly spinning;<br>
                            just tap when it points the right way and you’re winning.<br>
                            On squares that were pre-filled or you have submitted,<br>
                            re-tapping to re-hear a sound is permitted.
                        </p>
                        <p>
                            When finished, relax! You cannot be harmed<br>
                            when Kudosudoku is solved and disarmed.
