                <h2>On the Subject of Bomb It!</h2>
                <p class="flavour-text">Press It! Flip It! Snip It! Slide It! Tilt It! Boom It... no, don’t do that last one please...</p>
                <p>Press the play button at the top to start the module.</p>
                <p>A drum beat will start, and voice instructions will play. Perform the correct action <em>in sync with the kick drum of the drum beat.</em></p>
                <p>The required number of actions will be a random number between 6 and 10 inclusive.</p>
                <p>Performing the wrong action, not performing any action, or performing the correct action too early or too late will incur a strike.</p>
                <p>The following are the possible voice lines, along with their expected actions:</p>
                <ul>
                    <li><strong>Press It!</strong> Press the red button.</li>
                    <li><strong>Flip It!</strong> Flip the blue switch.</li>
                    <li><strong>Snip It!</strong> Snip the yellow wire.</li>
                    <li><strong>Slide It!</strong> Click and drag the green slider.</li>
                    <li><strong>Tilt It!</strong> Tilt the bomb up or down.</li>
                    <li><strong>Solve It!</strong> Press the status light. Doing so will disarm the module.</li>
                </ul>
                <div style="font-size: 10pt; font-style: italic;">
                    <p>Further Notes:</p>
                    <ul>
                        <li>There is a 0.4 second window of time for each action to be performed, except for Solve It!, which has a 0.8 second window of time.</li>
                        <li>Performing any action while the sequence is not playing will not incur a strike, except for attempting to snip the wire, as doing so would prevent Snip It! from appearing as a potential command.</li>
                        <li>If the Snip It! command was made, but not performed in time, it will incur a strike. However, to prevent a double strike, there is a 0.5 second window of time where snipping the wire will not incur a strike.</li>
                        <li>The Tilt It! command will check if the bomb is tilted upwards or downwards at an angle of at least 45 degrees.</li>
                    </ul>
