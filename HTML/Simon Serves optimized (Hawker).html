                <h2>On the Subject of Simon Serves</h2>
                <p class="flavour-text">Family dinners. Always a classic.</p>
                <p>
                    On the module you will see a dinner table with 6 colored pillars arranged around it. These are Simons guests.
                    The guests are <b>R</b>ed, <b>B</b>lue, <b>G</b>reen, <b>V</b>iolet, <b>W</b>hite and Blac<b>K</b>.
                    Initially the table is empty. Knock on the table once to signal to Simon that his guests have arrived and are ready to be served.
                    Simon will then serve six colored plates on the table. These are the dishes Simon serves his guests.
                    Each colored plate represents a drink or food Simon serves. The possible colors are: White, Brown, Red, Blue, Green, Yellow, Orange and Pink.
                </p>
                <p>Unfortunately, Simon doesn’t take orders. He will serve random dishes and drinks from which the guests must pick one each.</p>
                <p>
                    Once you knock on the table, the guests around the table will start flashing in a sequence.
                    This is your base order for the given stage. For each stage consider your base order and adjust it according to the stage rule.
                    That is your pick order. Then consider the priority lists in pick order and read them according to the stage rule.
                    For input press the first guest on your pick order, then the first dish you encountered on that guests priority list which is also served on the table.
                    Repeat this process for each guest, alternate between guest and dish until every guest is served.
                    Picking the guests in the wrong order or assigning them the wrong dish will cause a strike and make Simon angry.
                    He will clean the table and serve fresh dishes for the current stage.
                </p>
                <p>Note:<br> Consider the first and last flash to be connected into a loop.</p>
