                    <h2>On the Subject of Calculus</h2>
                    <p class="flavour-text">Lets be honest. Calculus is stressful for everyone. What's new is that it's on a bomb, as if it couldn't get worse.</p>

                    <p>Calculus modules are broken into three parts:<ul><li>The Equation: This can have 2-3 monomials.</li><li>The Answer Field: Answers can range from -9 to 9.</li><li>The Input and Submit Buttons.</li></ul></p>

                    <h3>Hidden Variables</h3>
					<p>Each equation given above can have 1-2 hidden variables. These variables can be found using information gathered from the side of the bomb, such as batteries, indicators, and ports. Each possible variable is listed below.</p>
                    <ul>
                        <li>If the equation has the variables Z or B, replace them with the least significant digit of the number of batteries.</li>
						<li>If the equation has the variables F or R, replace them with the least significant digit of the number of indicators.</li>
						<li>If the equation has the variables M or K, replace them with the least significant digit of the number of port plates, <b>NOT</b> the number of ports.</li>
                    </ul>
					<p>Additionally, if the two variables' sum is greater than 9, divide both variables by 2. If not a perfect divide, round down.<p class="flavour-text">Example: 5 / 2 = 2.5. The new variable is 2.</p></p>
                    <h3>Types of Problems</h3>
					<p>There are two types of problems shown on a module: Finding Integrals and Finding Derivatives. To determine the type of problem, check the degree of the base equation and the answer equation.</p><ul><li>If the degree of the answer is bigger than the base equation, solve with integration.</li><li>Otherwise find the derivative of the base equation.</li></ul>
					<h3>Entering an Answer</h3>
					<p>Enter an answer by changing the constant in front of the answer equation using the up and down arrows. If the constant should be a decimal, round it down. Finish by pressing the "Submit" button.</p>
