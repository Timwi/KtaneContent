                <h2>On the Subject of Sorry Sliders</h2>
                <p class="flavour-text">Say “SORRY!” one more goddamn time!</p>

                <p>This module is a recreation of the game <i>SORRY! Sliders</i>.
                You will see three pawns on a game board and a pawn on the shooting board.</p>

                <p>To shoot a pawn on the shooting board, first click one of the three directional arrows to aim,
                and then adjust the power bar to one of four levels. After that, click the “FIRE” button.
                The pawn will land on a space on the shooting board. The spaces are labelled 1, 2, 3, or 5.</p>

                <p>Based on the space landed on, use the table on the next page to determine how far you can move one of your pawns on the game board.
                You can only move one pawn at a time, and you must move the <b>exact</b> number of spaces forward.
                If you cannot move the specified number of spaces forward, or the pawn on the shooting board didn’t land on a number,
                fire a new pawn on the shooting board and try again.</p>

                <p>Move a pawn forward on the game board by pressing the new space that pawn will move to.
                If an incorrect space is pressed, or if you try to move a pawn out of turn, the module will strike.
                The module will <b>not</b> strike if a potentially successful move was not performed.
                The final space is the “HOME” space. Once all three pawns reach this space, the module solves.</p>

                <p>The surface of the shooting board will vary from module to module,
                but will remain consistent on each module.</p>
