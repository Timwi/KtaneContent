                <h2>On the Subject of Skinny Wires</h2>
                <p class="flavour-text">Wires so skinny you could cut them with nail scissors.</p>

                <ul>
                    <li>The module shows five wires connected to a combination of six ports labelled A–C & 1–3. Each wire will connect to one letter and one number.</li>
                    <li>Read the below rules and cut the wire indicated by the first rule that applies.</li>
                    <li>Cutting an incorrect wire will cause a strike.</li>
                  </ul>

                  <ol>
                    <li>If there is one red, one black, one white, one green and one orange wire, cut the red wire.</li>
                    <li>If the A-port is empty and the 3-port contains a black wire, cut any wire coming from the B-port.</li>
                    <li>If there are exactly two wires going to the 2-port and at least one of them is green, cut any wire going to either the 1-port or the 3-port.</li>
                    <li>If there are only two wire colours, cut a wire whose colour name is first alphabetically.</li>
                    <li>If there are three or more of the same colour wire in a single port, cut a wire whose colour name is first reverse alphabetically.</li>
                    <li>If there is a blue wire going to the 3-port, cut it.</li>
                    <li>If there is exactly one green and at least one orange wire, cut the green wire.</li>
                    <li>If there is exactly one black and exactly one white wire and exactly one of them goes to the 1-port, cut the one that does not go to the 1-port.</li>
                    <li>If there is a yellow wire going to the C-port, cut it.</li>
                    <li>If there is more than one pink wire, cut a pink wire.</li>
                    <li>If there is at least one red, at least one orange and no blue wires, cut an orange wire.</li>
                    <li>If the 3-port is empty, cut any wire going to the 1-port.</li>
                    <li>If the A-port has a wire leading to the 2-port, cut it.</li>
                    <li>If there are no green wires, cut a wire going to the first letter-port alphabetically that has a wire going to it.</li>
                    <li>If there are no blue wires, cut a wire going to the highest number-port that has a wire going to it.</li>
                    <li>If there is more than one of the same colour wire, cut any of those wires.</li>
                    <li>If there is a yellow wire, cut it.</li>
                    <li>If there is a black wire, cut it.</li>
                    <li>If there is a white wire, cut it.</li>
                    <li>Cut any wire going to the A-port.</li>
