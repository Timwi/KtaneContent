                    This module presents a machine with a monitor that flashes a sequence of six colors. There is a brief pause in between the last and first colors of the sequence.
                    The sequence will consist of the colors Red, White, Yellow, Blue, and Purple with one of the colors being repeated. To disarm the module, a series of six directions
                    corresponding to the six flashing colors must be inputted into the module.
                </p>
                <h3>Part 1: Assigning Information to the Colors</h3>
                <ol>
                    <li>Make a list with five slots. Each slot consists of a color, a variable, and a constant. Variables refer to a specific flash in the sequence while constants refer to a single color.</li>
                    <li>The first slot’s color is assigned to the first flash’s color.</li>
                    <li>
                        Use the below table to assign the previously obtained slot its variable and constant. If a obtained variable’s color is the same as a previously-assigned variable,
                        proceed forward through the sequence until a flash whose color has not been assigned a slot is reached, wrapping from the last flash to the first if necessary.
                        Assign this obtained flash as the variable instead.
                    </li>
                    <li>The next slot’s color will be the previous slot’s variable’s color.</li>
                    <li>Repeat steps 3 and 4 until the fifth slot is assigned its color. The fifth slot has no variable and its constant is assigned the slot’s color. Reassign the variables to the color of its flash.</li>
                </ol>

                <ol>
                    <li>Add another attribute to each slot in the list: its actual direction.</li>
                    <li>This module uses an eight-way directional system. Replace each constant with one of eight directions using this table:
                        <table>
                            <tr>
                                <th>Colors</th><td>White</td><td>Purple</td><td>Red</td><td>Blue</td><td>Yellow</td>
                            </tr>
                            <tr id="directions">
                                <th>Direction</th><td>Up</td><td>Left</td><td>Up + Right</td><td>Down + Right</td><td>Up + Left</td>
                            </tr>
                        </table>
                    </li>
                    <li>Assign the fifth slot’s actual direction as its constant’s direction.</li>
                    <li>Move to the previous slot. Replace the variable with the previous slot’s actual direction.</li>
                    <li>
                        Starting from the variable, count the number of clockwise or counterclockwise rotations necessary to rotate to the constant. Then, rotate the same number of times
                        starting from the constant in the same direction. If the resulting direction is the same as any other slot’s actual direction, rotate one step clockwise until a
                        unique direction is obtained. The resulting direction is assigned to this slot’s actual direction.
                    </li>
                    <li>Repeat steps 3, 4, and 5 until all five slots have been assigned an actual direction. Each color is now associated with the actual direction of its slot.</li>

                <ul>
                    <li>This module will never strike.</li>
                    <li>Six directions must be submitted to the module. The six directions are the directions associated with the six flashing colors of the sequence in order.</li>
                    <li>
                        To start submission, select the module. An upbeat jingle will play, and static will continuously play in the background. To cancel submission, delect the module,
                        select it again, then deselect it again. The static will stop playing. Submission may be cancelled at any time.
                    </li>
                    <li>When selecting the module to begin submission, select the module straight-on. Selecting the module at an angle will skew its calibration.</li>
                    <li>
                        To submit a specific direction, rotate the bomb in that direction while the module is selected. The submitted direction will briefly flash on the module’s hinges
                        with an accompanying chime.
                    </li>
                    <li>Once the last six directions submitted to the module are the associated directions with the six flashes in order, the module will solve.</li>
