                <ul>
                    <li>The module shows a colour indicator and ten flashing lights with corresponding buttons.</li>
                    <li>If the module also has a 2 digit display on the top left, you are looking at the wrong module.</li>
                    <li>The light will flash in of ten colours (see the table below). An initial will confirm the colour for both the light and the colour indicator.</li>
                    <li>There are 5 stages. On each stage, a 3–5 note sequence will flash and a colour will be displayed on the indicator. Each stage will also show the flashing colours and their indicators of previous stages.</li>
                    <li>Submit the correct sequence of each stage for each stage (in order).</li>
                    <li>A strong press will indicate the end of the input for that given sequence.</li>
                    <li>If an error has been made upon completing the entire sequence, a strike will occur. The module will redisplay the entire sequence for this stage until all inputs are correct for this stage.</li>
                    <li>Upon 5 completed stages, the module will disarm.</li>
