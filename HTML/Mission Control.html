                <h2>On the Subject of Mission Control</h2>
                <p class="flavour-text">Houston, we have a bunch of problems.</p>

                <p>
                    This is a utility module used to alter how missions are usually played.
                    This includes changing the bomb's time, changing the game music, or hiding modules until criteria are met.
                    The effects are different depending on the mission.
                </p>

                <h3>Mission Detection</h3>
                <p>
                    If the module has successfully detected a supported mission, an ominous sound can be heard notifying its presence.
                    The bomb will be affected by whatever is configured for that mission.
                </p>

                <p>If the module displays “<strong>ERROR</strong>”, then no supported mission was detected. This will not affect the bomb in any way.</p>

                <p>
                    If the module displays “<strong>FATAL ERROR</strong>”, then the module was unable to detect missions at all.
                    This could be due to an exception from the code, or a computer-specific issue.
                    This will also not affect the bomb in any way, and can circumvent how a mission was meant to be played.
                </p>

                <h3>Solving</h3>
                <p>
                    Under normal circumstances, the module will always solve the same way.
                    However, certain missions may change how the module is solved.
                </p>

                <p>
                    <strong>Solving normally:</strong><br>
                    Press the button on the module when the seconds digits of the bomb's timer equal the sum of the digits in the serial number.
                </p>

                <p>
                    <strong>Dead End:</strong><br>
                    On the larger bomb, the module functions like normal.
                    The timer starts at normal speed but gradually accelerates as the bomb progresses.
                    The highest speed it can reach without a boost from strikes is 400%.
                    <br>
                    On the smaller bomb, the module cannot be interacted with and will solve once the larger bomb is defused.
                    The timer will always display 55 seconds.
                </p>

                <p>
                    <strong>Disconnected:</strong><br>
                    The module functions like normal. If there is exactly one unsolved module left on the bomb, the timer increases to 600% speed, regardless of strikes.
                </p>

                <p>
                    <strong>Precise Instability:</strong><br>
                    Whenever a module on the bomb strikes, all the modules disappear except for this one, the timer freezes, and a 30-second countdown will start on the module.
                    If the button is pressed while the timer displays the correct digit, one strike will be subtracted from the bomb.
                    Once the countdown ends, the timer resumes and the rest of the modules reappear, and the module returns to its normal state.
                    <br>
                    The number you need to press the button on is based on either the starting time* or the most recent frozen time after a strike.
                    If the frozen timer flickers between two numbers, use the higher number.
                    Take that time modulo 20 seconds. If you get 0, make it 20.
                    <span class="flavour-text">*The timer will play an animation at the start of the bomb.
                    The starting time is the time displayed after the animation ends.</span>
                    <br>
                    In addition, this module will also have to be solved normally.
                    The countdown timer will still start even after this module is solved, and will still need to be interacted with.
                    If at any point, the bomb exceeds the maximum strikes allotted, regardless if any were subtracted, the bomb will explode.
                </p>

                <p>
                    <strong>Wish:</strong><br>
                    Press the button on the module to reveal a hidden module.
                    If the module believes there aren’t enough solved modules on the bomb, 10% of the bomb's current time will be reduced.
                    The module will solve once all hidden modules are revealed.
