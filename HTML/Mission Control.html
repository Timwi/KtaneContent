                <h2>On the Subject of Mission Control</h2>
                <p class="flavour-text">Houston, we have a bunch of problems.</p>

                <p>
                    This is a utility module used to alter how missions are usually played.
                    This includes changing the bomb’s time, changing the game music, or hiding modules until criteria are met.
                    The effects are different depending on the mission.
                </p>

                <h3>Mission Detection</h3>
                <p>
                    If the module has successfully detected a supported mission, an ominous sound can be heard notifying its presence.
                    The bomb will be affected by whatever is configured for that mission.
                </p>

                <p>If the module displays “<strong>ERROR</strong>”, then no supported mission was detected. This will not affect the bomb in any way.</p>

                <p>
                    If the module displays “<strong>FATAL ERROR</strong>”, then the module was unable to detect missions at all.
                    This could be due to an exception from the code, or a computer-specific issue.
                    This will also not affect the bomb in any way, and can circumvent how a mission was meant to be played.
                </p>

                <h3>Solving</h3>
                <p>
                    Under normal circumstances, the module will always solve the same way.
                    However, certain missions may change how the module is solved.
                </p>

                <p>
                    <strong>Solving normally:</strong><br>
                    Press the button on the module when the seconds digits of the bomb’s timer equal the sum of the digits in the serial number.
                </p>

                <p>
                    <strong>Dead End:</strong><br>
                    On the larger bomb, the module solves like normal. 
                    The timer starts at normal speed but gradually accelerates as the bomb progresses.
                    The highest speed it can reach without a boost from strikes is 400%.
                </p>
                <p>
                    On the smaller bomb, the module cannot be interacted with and will solve once the larger bomb is defused.
                    The timer will always display 55 seconds.
                </p>

                <p>
                    <strong>Disconnected:</strong><br>
                    The module solves like normal. If there is exactly one unsolved module left on the bomb, the timer increases to 600% speed, regardless of strikes.

                    <strong>The Father of the Abyss:</strong><br>
                    The module solves like normal. 
                    The screen’s field of view gradually shrinks as the bomb progresses.
                </p>

                <p>
                    <strong>Flyer’s Manual Curse:</strong><br>
                    The module solves like normal. 
                    The bomb’s actual strike limit is displayed on the module, starting at one strike. 
                    The strike limit will increase by one for every five solves, until reaching the maximum at eight strikes. 
                    If at any point the bomb exceeds the strike limit, the bomb will explode.
                </p>
                
                <p>
                    <strong>For No Eyes Only:</strong><br>
                    The screen will be completely black for the entire bomb until all modules are solved, making you unable to see anything.
                    Pressing the button will make a mysterious voice read out a series of characters, which is the bomb’s serial number. 
                    No other widgets appear on the bomb.
                </p>
                <p>
                    The module will then solve afterwards. The button can be pressed as many times as you like to repeat the characters.
                </p>
                
                <p>
                    <strong>Lost To Time:</strong><br>
                    The module solves like normal. 
                    Solving modules will add time to the timer based on the bomb’s strike count and the difficulty of the solved module. 
                    The bomb’s timer also does not accelerate until the bomb has at least five strikes.
                </p>
                <p>
                    Here is a table showing the multipliers of the timer speeds and the amount of time gained per solved module:

                    <strong>The Mountain:</strong><br>
                    The button will initally have a <i>golden strawberry</i>. Press the button while the berry is present to grab it.
                    Solving any module before grabbing it will cause it to disappear. If you grab it, getting a strike will immediately detonate the bomb.
                    Grabbing it will also add one hour to the bomb’s time, but you must complete the bomb within its original time limit.
                    In either case, pressing the button will solve the module.
                </p>

                <p>
                    <strong>Precise Instability:</strong><br>
                    Whenever a module on the bomb strikes, all the modules disappear except for this one, the timer freezes, and a 30-second countdown will start on the module.
                    If the button is pressed while the timer displays the correct digit, one strike will be subtracted from the bomb.
                    Once the countdown ends, the timer resumes and the rest of the modules reappear, and the module returns to its normal state.
                </p>
                <p>
                    The number you need to press the button on is based on either the starting time* or the most recent frozen time after a strike.
                    If the frozen timer flickers between two numbers, use the higher number.
                    Take that time modulo 20 seconds. If you get 0, make it 20.
                    <span class="flavour-text">*The timer will play an animation at the start of the bomb.
                    The starting time is the time displayed after the animation ends.</span>
                </p>
                <p>
                    In addition, this module will also have to be solved normally.
                    The countdown timer will still start even after this module is solved, and will still need to be interacted with.
                    If at any point, the bomb exceeds the maximum strikes allotted, regardless if any were subtracted, the bomb will explode.
                </p>

                <p>
                    <strong>Wish:</strong><br>
                    Press the button on the module to reveal a hidden module.
                    If the module believes there aren’t enough solved modules on the bomb, 10% of the bomb’s current time will be reduced.
                    The module will solve once all hidden modules are revealed.
