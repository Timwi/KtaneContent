                <h2>On the Subject of Mission Control</h2>
                <p class="flavour-text">Houston, we have a bunch of problems.</p>

                <p>
                    This is a utility module used to alter how missions are usually played.
                    This includes changing the bomb's time, changing the game music, or hiding modules until criteria are met.
                    The effects are different depending on the mission.
                </p>

                <h3>Mission Detection</h3>
                <p>
                    If the module has successfully detected a supported mission, an ominous sound can be heard notifying its presence.
                    The bomb will be affected by whatever is configured for that mission.
                </p>

                <p>If the module displays “<strong>ERROR</strong>”, then no supported mission was detected. This will not affect the bomb in any way.</p>

                <p>
                    If the module displays “<strong>FATAL ERROR</strong>”, then the module was unable to detect missions at all.
                    This could be due to an exception from the code, or a computer-specific issue.
                    This will also not affect the bomb in any way, and can circumvent how a mission was meant to be played.
                </p>

                <h3>Solving</h3>
                <p>
                    Under normal circumstances, the module will always solve the same way.
                    However, certain missions may change how the module is solved.
                </p>

                <p>
                    <strong>Solving normally:</strong><br>
                    Press the button on the module when the seconds digits of the bomb's timer equal the sum of the digits in the serial number.
                </p>

                <p>
                    <strong>Dead End:</strong><br>
                    On the larger bomb, the module functions like normal.
                    On the smaller bomb, the module cannot be interacted with and will solve once the larger bomb is defused.
                </p>

                <p>
                    <strong>Wish:</strong><br>
                    Press the button on the module to reveal a hidden module.
                    If the module believes there aren't enough solved modules on the bomb, 10% of the bomb's current time will be reduced.
                    The module will solve once all hidden modules are revealed.
