                <h2>On the Subject of Silo Authorization</h2>
                <p class="flavour-text">There’s no way to win. The game itself is pointless!</p>

                <ul>
                <li>Press the “Receive” button. After 20%–40% of the bomb’s remaining time has passed, or a minimum of 30 seconds, an encrypted message will be spoken. You may repeat the message as desired by pressing “Receive” again, still waiting 30 seconds after the button is pressed. If you strike, a new message is generated.</li>
                <li>Ignore the first part of the message. The important parts are:
                <ul>
                    <li>the <em>code</em> (a color followed by “Alpha”);</li>
                    <li>two <em>messages</em> of four characters each (spoken one after another as an 8-character sequence);</li>
                    <li>an <em>authentication code</em> (4 digits).</li>
                </ul>
                </li>
                <li>Obtain the <em>Silo ID</em> and the <em>Launch Location</em> as follows. Each consists of three base-36 digits. Take the values modulo 36.

                </table>
                </li>
                <li>Decrypt both messages as described in the section <em>Encryption/Decryption</em> below. The decrypted messages are 3 characters each (total of 6 characters).</li>
                <li>Multiply the first of those 6 characters with the first character of the serial number, the second with the second, etc., then add up the results. Letters are A=10, ..., Z=35.</li>
                <li>If this sum <em>does not</em> equal the received authentication code, your response message will be as follows:
                <ul>
                    <li>1st character of the first decrypted message</li>
                    <li>2nd character of the second decrypted message</li>

                <li>Otherwise, if each individual character in the second decrypted message is contained in the serial number, respond with that second message.</li>
                <li>Otherwise, respond with the following message:
                <ul>
                    <li>1st character of the second decrypted message</li>

                <li>Encrypt the response using any cipher that was not used by the received message. Prepend it with the digit identifying the cipher (0, 1, or 2).</li>
                <li>Construct the response <em>authentication code</em> as follows:
                <ul>
                    <li>If your received <em>code</em> was “Red-Alpha”, use the <em>Launch Location</em>; otherwise, use the <em>Silo ID</em>.</li>
                    <li>Multiply the first of the 3 characters with the first character of the unencrypted response message, the second with the second, etc., then add up the results. Letters are A=10, ..., Z=35.</li>
                </ul></li>
                <li>Enter the authentication code, Silo ID, encrypted message and launch location into the module and press Send to disarm the module.</li>
