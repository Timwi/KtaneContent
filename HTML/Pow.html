                    <h2>On the Subject of Pow</h2>
                    <p class="flavour-text">You should learn to treat retro bossfights with respect, or else they will end up on your bomb.</p>
                    
                    <p>This module is themed after the game Nervous Brickdown, specifically the world 1 bossfight. On the module will be an animated background and 10 clickable moving diamonds, which are all pieces of the boss.</p>
                    
                    <p>To solve the module, the defuser must destroy all pieces of the boss without disobeying the Destruction Rules below. Pressing one of the pieces will cause that piece to lose a layer. Each piece has 3 layers, pink outermost, grey middlemost, and black with a red glow innermost. The outermost 2 layers are what need to be destroyed to destroy that piece of the boss.</p> 
                    
                    <p><strong>BE WARNED!</strong> The boss is normally in a passive phase where the defuser can destroy the pieces, however the boss can enter an attack phase where 3 LEDs pop out of the module which the defuser may interact with. All pieces which had a PINK layer when the boss entered attack phase will attack certain LEDs with a crosshair indicating where the next one will attack. To avoid an attack, move the green LED away from a crosshair by pressing any of the other LEDs.</p>
                
                    <p>Attempting to destroy a layer which disobeys the Destruction Rules or being hit by a piece during an attack phase will cause a strike.</p>
                    
                    <h3>Destruction Rules</h3>
                    <ol>
                        <li>The defuser may destroy up to a certain number of layers normally per passive phase, which can be determined using the table below.</li>
                        <li>All pink layers must be destroyed first, unless rule 4 is in effect.</li>
                        <li>If the number of minutes currently left on the bomb is a multiple of 5 (not 1 or 0), then this limit is restricted to 1 layer.</li>
                        <li>If the number of minutes currently left on the bomb is a multiple of 3 (not 1 or 0), then only grey layers may be destroyed.</li>
                        <li>If the bomb has less than or equal to 30 seconds left on it, then there is no limit.</li>
                        <li>If all pink layers have been destroyed, then there is no limit but rule 3 can still apply.</li>
