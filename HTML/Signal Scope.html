                <h2>On the Subject of Signal Scope</h2>
                <p class="flavour-text">Listen for what the universe offers you.</p>

                <p>You are on a planet in a solar system. Every planet is moving. Each other planet has a traveller playing their instrument. You can hear an instrument being played by pointing your scope at it. Identify which instrument is being played on the planet farthest from the sun and point your scope in the instrument's direction. Press the center submit button when the scope is oriented correctly and the ten seconds digit of the timer corresponds to the instrument on the planet closest to the sun to solve the module.</p>
                <p>The instruments correspond to the numbers 0 through 5 and directions starting with North going clockwise in order: Banjo, Clarinet, Drums, Harmonica, Piano, Whistling</p>
