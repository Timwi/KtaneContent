                <h2>On the Subject of Fifty Blessings</h2>
                <p class="flavour-text">Thank you for subscribing to our newsletter. We appreciate your interest in our cause. America is a tune. It must be sung together.</p>

                <ul>
                    <li>You work for Fifty Blessings and you’re expecting a few phone calls soon for your next mission.</li>
                    <li>The module consists of a display of four blueprints that can be cycled through using the arrow buttons.</li>
                    <li>Determine which location to drive to using the received phone call, and submit the correct blueprint using the eject button. Note that the module will always start off on Blueprint 1.</li>
                </ul>
                <p class="highlightable">At the beginning of the bomb and every minute (60 seconds) after, the phone on the module will ring. Click the phone’s keypad to pick up. You have 5 seconds to pick it up, even though it audibly rings once.</p>
                <p class="highlightable">Depending on the first and second time the phone is picked up, follow the table below to find which MAZE KEY to follow. Picking up the phone a third time will play the first call, a fourth time will play the second call, etc. The names are of the “people” making the calls. See Appendix M1SS10N for a full list of possible phone calls.</p>

                <p>Find the maze with the same label as your MAZE KEY in <u>Appendix PH0N3B00K</u>. Rows are letters (topmost is A, bottom is E) and columns are numbers (leftmost is 1, rightmost is 5). Determine 2 coordinates using the following rules:</p>
                <ul>
                    <li>The first coordinate is located at X#, where X is the first letter of your serial number subtracted by 5 letters until it is within the range of A – E, and # is the first number of your serial number added to / subtracted by 5 until it is between 1 and 5. If your serial number has no letters, use A. If your serial number has no numbers, go through the same process but start instead with the number of non-needy modules on the bomb.</li>
                    <li>The second coordinate can be determined in the same fashion but with the second letter and digit of the serial number. If your serial number has no letters, use B. If your serial number has no number, go through the same process but start instead with the number of batteries on the bomb.</li>
                </ul>
                <p>Using the determined coordinates, follow the rules below to determine which blueprint to select, with A representing the first coordinate and B the second:</p>
