                <h2>On the Subject of Chicken Nuggets</h2>
                <p class="flavour-text">The things mathematicians do in their free time are questionable.</p>

                <ul>
                    <li>You are a homeless man who recently got hired at the small restaurant down the street called McDonald's.</li>
                    <li>The McDonald's corporation sell chicken nuggets in packs of <span id='nuggetCounts'>six, nine, and twenty</span>, all of which relate to the corresponding buttons in the bottom row in the previously mentioned order.</li>
                    <li>A customer will order a certain amount of chicken nuggets as shown in black text, and you must give him his exact order.</li>
                    <li>To add to your current nugget amount, press their corresponding buttons. Press the button on top to give your current nugget amount to the customer.</li>
                    <li>If the customer wants an amount of chicken nuggets that is simply impossible to make, then hold the button to drown the customer and get a bonus check by your boss.</li>
                    <li>If the customer receives too many nuggets, he dies of obesity. If he receives too little, he will starve to death. Both scenarios will result in your termination.</li>
