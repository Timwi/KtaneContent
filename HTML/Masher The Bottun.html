                <h2>On the Subject of Masher The Bottun</h2>
                <p class="flavour-text">To be fair, you have to have a very high IQ to understand Lama modules. The solving method is very complex, and without a solid grasp of theoretical physics, most of the manual will go over a typical expert's head.</p>

                <p>On the module is a black screen with a yellow number on it, and a white "PUSH" button, which will decrease the number by 1. To solve the module, get the number to 0.</p>
                <p>However, you can only press the button at certain times, based on the results of the last time you pressed it. You can press the button the first time at any time. <b>Please read to at least the end of Section 1 before starting the module.</b></p>
                <p>When you press the button, something will happen to the module. The different outcomes are listed below. Go to the section based on what happened, and determine when to press the button next. The same outcome will not happen twice (except for Section 1). Pressing a button incorrectly will still advance the module but will administer a strike.</p>
                <p>The changes made to the module will switch back after pressing the button again, unless stated otherwise below.</p>

                <h3>Potential Outcomes of Mashing the Bottun</h3>
                <ol>
                    <li>Nothing</li>
                    <li>Number changes color (number will stay this color)</li>
                    <li>Button background changes color (button background will stay this color)</li>
                    <li>Button text changes (button text will stay changed)</li>
                    <li>Screen goes blank, then starts flashing Morse</li>
                    <li>Number starts changing rapidly</li>
                    <li>Number spins (number slows to a stop upon pressing the button)</li>
                    <li>Module spins (module will be left at the orientation it was last at)</li>
                    <li>Voice plays</li>
                    <li>Sound effect plays</li>
                </ol>

                <h3>Section 1 - Nothing</h3>
                <p>You can press the "PUSH" button at any time, <b>as long as it is within two seconds of your last press.</b> Fortunately, when you strike due to pressing the button at the wrong time, you are exempt for this rule for one press.</p>
                <p>This option is far more common than the other options; exactly 4 presses will not be from this section.</p>

                <h3>Section 2 - Number changes color</h3>
                <p>Take the color of the number, and look in the row corresponding to it. Read this as binary, where the cells that have at least one character in common with the serial number are 1s, and the other cells are 0s. Press the button when the last digit of the countdown timer is this number, modulo 10. (Zeroes are marked as Ø.)</p>

                <h3>Section 6 - Number starts changing rapidly</h3>
                <p>The number will suddenly cycle through three numbers. Take all three pairs of consecutive numbers, and follow the first rule that applies to each pair.</p>
                <p></p>

                <ol>
                    <li>If the first number is at least 50 greater than the second number, add the two numbers.</li>
                    <li>If the second number is at least 50 greater than the first number, take the digital root of the two numbers concatenated.</li>
                    <li>If the first number is at least 25 greater than the second number, multiply the numbers.</li>
                    <li>If the second number is at least 25 greater than the first number, concatenate the last digits of the numbers.</li>
                    <li>If the first number is greater than the second number, use the positive difference between the two numbers.</li>
                    <li>If the second number is greater than the first number, average the two numbers, and round down if necessary.</li>
                    <li>If the numbers are the same, just use zero.</li>
                </ol>

                <p>Modulo all three numbers by 100, concatenate them, and take the digital root. Press the button when the last digit of the timer is equal to that number.</p>

                <h3>Section 7 - Number spins</h3>
                <p>In the table below, start at the cell corresponding to the last digit of the number currently on the module. If the last digit of the number is 0 or 1, start at the cell that's X cells clockwise from the top-left, where X is the second digit of the serial number.</p>
                <p>Move, in the direction that the number is spinning, a number of cells around the ring equal to the most significant digit of the number on the module.</p>
                <p>Repeat the above step until you have hit every cell. If you land on a cell you already landed on, move one more cell in the direction you're moving. Press the button when the last digit of the timer is equal to the digit in the last cell you landed on.</p>
