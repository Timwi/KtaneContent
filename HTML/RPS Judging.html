                    <h2>On the Subject of RPS Judging</h2>
                    <p class="flavour-text">Deciding everytime when they fight</p>
					<p>You are a scorer on the complex game named RPS 101. Two teams battle each other to decide which team will win and go first in their game (not this one).</p>
					<p>Every 30 seconds in realtime after the timer started counting down (or up), they will perform a round of RPS 101. Decide which team wins on the round given. If a tie occurs, no team gets a point.</p>
					<p>If all modules have been solved, or if the round will go over 999999999999, the referee will blow the whistle and stop the game. The referee will provide an additional 5 seconds
					after whistling before going to the scoring board.</p>
					<br>
					<h4>The Scoring Board</h4>
					<p>In this scenario, you must provide the scores of each them. Provide the score of the blue team, then the read team. However, there are restrictions on how you can submit the scores. These are the following rules:</p>
					<ul>
					<li><strong>You must provide the correct score. This is a pretty obvious rule.</strong></li>
					<li><strong>You must not give a blank score on any of the scoring board.</strong></li>
					<li><strong>If the score is not one digit long, you must not start with a zero.</strong></li>
					</ul>
					<br>
					<h4>The Decision Flags</h4>
					<p>In this scenario, you must dictate the winner of the game to your referee. Determine which team has the highest score. Use the flags to determine the winning team. The color determines the corresponding team. If a tie occurs, select the gray flags instead of the colored flags.</p>

					<p>After you dictate the supposed winner to the referee, every info will be verified by a computer. If even one info provided is incorrect, the referee will tell you that a mistake has occured. You will be sent back to the scoring
					board to provide a brand new info, and a strike will be given. If all info given are correct, the referee will announce the result and the module will be solved.</p>
