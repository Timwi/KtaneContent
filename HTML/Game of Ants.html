                <h2>On the Subject of Game of Ants</h2>
                <p class="flavour-text">The Circle rules your life.</p>
                <ul>
                    <li>On this module is a 5×5 grid of cells that can be white or black. Within this grid, there are up to five red ants.</li>
                    <li>This is the initial state of a cellular automaton. To defuse the module, determine the state of the grid after the following steps have been performed.</li>
                </ul>
                <ol>
                    <li>Perform one iteration of <a target="_blank" href="Game%20of%20Life%20Simple.html">Game of Life</a> on the cells of the grid, ignoring the ants.</li>
                    <li>All ants simultaneously move one space forwards, toggling the state of cell it exited from.</li>
                    <li>If two or more ants end up on the same cell, apply these steps in order:
                        <ul>
                            <li>If the ants are facing in different directions, all move another space forwards.</li>
                            <li>If the ants are facing the same direction, all but one ant move another space forwards.</li>
                        </ul>
                    </li>
                    <li>If any ant leaves the grid, skip to step 6.</li>
                    <li>Each ant turns to its left if ends up on a black cell, or to its right if it ends up on a white cell. Repeat steps 2 to 5.</li>
                    <li>Perform another iteration of Game of Life on the resulting grid, once again ignoring the ants.</li>
                </ol>
                <p>To change the state of the grid, select a cell within it.</p>
                <ul>
                    <li>If the blinking button is active, selecting a cell toggles its state.</li>
                    <li>If the ant button is active:
                        <ul>
                            <li>Selecting an empty cell will place an ant on it in the orientation of the button.</li>
                            <li>Selecting a cell with an ant in a different orientation to the button changes the ant’s orientation to match.</li>
                            <li>Selecting a cell with an ant in the same orientation as the button removes the ant from the cell.</li>
                        </ul>
                    </li>
                    <li>Selecting either the blinking or ant button will activate that button and deactivate the other.
                        <ul>
                            <li>Selecting the ant button while it is active rotates it 90&deg; clockwise.</li>
                        </ul>
                    </li>
                    <li>Selecting an arrow marks a location where at least one ant left the grid.<br>Doing so will also activate the ant button and set its orientation to the direction of the arrow.</li>
