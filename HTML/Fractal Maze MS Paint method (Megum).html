                <h2>On the Subject of Painting Fractal Maze</h2>
                <p class="flavour-text">Mac users shivering in their timbers...</p>
                <p>The following algorithm describes how to utilize MS Paint functionality to solve the module.</p>
                <ol>
                    <li>Home → Resize: Resize by pixels, Maintain aspect ration OFF, Vertical-64, Horizontal-64</li>
                    <li>View → Zoom in (spam until max zoom)</li>
                    <li>Home → Pencil. Use the top-left 2×2 pixels and paint them with colours from the module. 
                        Keep in mind that the sheet is white by default, although white on the module means all 3 transformations.</li>
                    <li>Home → Select. Select the top-left 2×2 pixels. Now resize the selected box to be the size of the entire picture
                        by dragging the bottom-right of the box to the bottom-right of the entire sheet
                        (start dragging from the C3 pixel, not B2, because Paint is weird)</li>
                    <li>Copy and paste the selected picture. Now resize it to 32×32 pixels and place over 
                        one of the 3 corners. Based on what corner colour you put it over perform the transformation 
                        (right click → rotate) on it 
                        (in RGB order, for each component present: R → flip vertical, G → flip horizontal, B → rotate 90° clockwise).
                        Repeat for the other 2 present corners (using the original 64×64 picture 
                        from the start of the iteration (it is still supposed to be in your clipboard)).
                        Once finished, your maze should look like a 4×4 pixel image (this is iteration 1)</li>
                    <li>Now select and copy the entire new picture. This is the start of the new iteration.
                        Perform actions from the previous step (assuming there are still 3 big corners with the same colours).
                        Once finished, your maze should look like a 8×8 pixel image (iteration 2)</li>
                    <li>Repeat the previous step once to get the final 16×16 maze (iteration 3)</li>
                    <li>When the module decreases the iteration just use Ctrl+Z.</li>
                </ol>
