                <p>
                    The module will show an order button, and pressing it will start the order. Once the order is finished, ingredient buttons will show up on the module.
                    As a proud Subway Sandwich Artist™, you would never make a sandwich out of order, and ingredients will always show up in
                    the order: breads, meats, cheese, veggies, condiments. In addition, there will be a ? button in the bottom left that you can press at
                    any time to ask the customer to restate their order. This can be done as many times as you like for no cost other than the customer’s sanity.
                </p>

                <p>
                    To solve this module, mess up the order with changes that add up to as close to the tip threshold as possible. There can be multiple
                    correct answers. To get the value of a change, see the table below the explicit rules. To calculate the tip threshold, first take the
                    greatest number from the number of battery holders, port plates, and indicators, and multiply by 3. Then, add the bomb’s voltage, if any,
                    and round down. If the tip threshold is 0, you don’t mess up the order.
                </p>

                <p>Never remove a vegetable if it is the last vegetable on the sandwich.</p>

                <p>Always toast a sandwich if the customer specifically asks for it. However, you may avoid toasting a sandwich if the customer only asks for a melt.</p>
                <p>
                    If a customer asks for extra of anything, always give them the normal amount.
                    However, if the customer specifically asks for asmuch of something that will get you fired,
                    add that ingredient (when you get to it in the sandwich order) until the module solves.
                </p>

                <p>Never give a customer whole wheat bread, even if they ask for it.</p>

                <p>If a customer asks for Ketchup, just don’t give it to them.</p>

                <p>
                    If the customer orders a sandwich with tuna in it, substitute the tuna for extra mayonnaise.
                    (This won’t count against the tipthreshold and changing or removing the mayonnaise will count as changing or removing a condiment.)
                </p>

                <p>Never add an item without removing an equivalent item (i.e. changing an item).</p>

                <p>If enough tip threshold is left after previous required changes, always put the wrong cheese if the customer asks for cheese.</p>

                <p>While technically possible while adding the bread, don’t give the customer a sandwich when they asked for a pizza.</p>

                <h3>Clarifications</h3>

                <p>Pizza can be found when bread is selectable, and changing which kind of pizza it is counts as changing the bread.</p>
                <p>Whether you toast the bread or not can be chosen when cheese is selectable, and changing the toast of a sandwich counts as removing a cheese.</p>

                <p>Removing or changing an item will always count against the tip threshold unless otherwise stated.</p>
