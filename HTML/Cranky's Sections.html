                <h2>On the Subject of Cranky's Sections</h2>
                <p class="flavour-text">oh my god i just realized why he's called cranky.<br/>
Its because cranky is (or moves like) a <b>Crank</b><br/>
its. <b>a pun.</b></p>

                <p>This module contains:</p>
                <ul>
                    <li>Cranky, the main character of <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/app/3045200/Beatblock/">Beatblock</a>;</li>
                    <li>Accuracy and judgement counter on the top right;</li>
                    <li>Stage counter on the top.</li>
                </ul>
                <p>Everything else is purely cosmetical.</p>
                <p>This is a <a href="https://ktane.timwi.de/More/Glossary.html#boss-module">boss module</a>. Every time a <a href="https://ktane.timwi.de/More/Ignore%20Table.html#mod=crankysSections">non-ignored module</a> is solved, this module will show a new stage.</p>
                <p>On every stage, the module shows a percentage, and may show an amount of barelies and/or an amount of misses. If any of these amounts are absent, consider them as 0. Every miss is 1 point, every barely is 0.25 points. Also, for each stage, the module picks some amount of all notes in this section. The percentage is calculated like this:</p>
                <p style="text-align: center"><code>percentage = (notes-points)/notes</code>,</p>
                <p>and is rounded down to 2 decimal digits.</p>
                <p>To solve the module, enter the total percentage of all sections. To do that, you'll have to find amount of notes for every stage. Be aware, that amount of notes for every stage is minimal as possible. If defining the amount of notes is impossible (as in any amount is applicable), then module picks <b>250</b> as the amount.</p>
                <p>If you've entered a wrong answer, you can press the "&lt;" button to enter Failsafe State. It will show all stages. To exit, press the button with the label "Page #/#".</p>
                <p>If there are no stages to show, input 100.00% as the final answer.</p>
