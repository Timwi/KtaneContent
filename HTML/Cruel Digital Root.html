                <h2>On the Subject of Cruel Digital Root</h2>
                <p class="flavour-text">I just knew it was too easy!</p>

                <p>This module has eight displays, six of which are in a row and two of which are below the six towards the right, each displaying numbers one through nine. There is also two buttons, which can have different colors and texts on them. One of these buttons is considered the "Yes" button while the other is considered the "No" button.</p>

                <p>To solve the module, you must determine whether to press the “Yes” or “No” button. To do this, take the digital root* of the sum of the numbers from the top six displays. Then, take the digital root* of the sum of the other two display's numbers. If the two resulting numbers are equal, the "Yes" button must be pressed. Otherwise, the "No" button must be pressed. <strong>However if a Lit SIG indicator is on the bomb and no "5" is present on any of the top six displays, the "Yes" button must always be pressed.</strong></p>

                <p>Due to the random colors and texts displayed on the buttons, the "Yes" and "No" buttons cannot be easily identified. The <strong>Button Determining Table</strong> will help with this problem.

                <p>If the wrong button is pressed a strike will be recorded and the module WILL reset.</p>

                <h3>Button Determining Table</h3>
                <p>The columns represent the different possible texts, while the rows represent the different possible colors. Find where both overlap for one of the buttons to find out which it is.

                <p><i>* - The digital root of a number is the sum of all of the digits that make up a number until it is one digit, so if the result is still more than one digit after one sum the process repeats. For example the digital root of "65" would be "2" as <br>6 + 5 = 11, then 1 + 1 = 2.</i></p>
