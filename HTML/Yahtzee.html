                <h2>On the Subject of Yahtzee</h2>
                <p class="flavour-text">When has bomb defusal ever been a game of chance?</p>

                <p>There are five dice in the colors of purple, yellow, blue, white and black. Start by rolling the dice.
                    Then choose which dice to keep and which to reroll. You may only keep dice of the same value.
                    Keep repeating this process until you get a Yahtzee.<sup>*</sup></p>
                <p>At each stage, the dice to keep are given by the following rules:</p>

                <h3>If you just rolled 5 dice:</h3>
                <p>Follow the first rule that applies:</p>
                <ul>
                    <li><strong>Large straight:</strong><sup>*</sup> keep the die with the highest value equal to a digit in the serial number; if none, keep the purple.
                    <li><strong>Small straight:</strong><sup>*</sup> keep the outlier.<sup>*</sup>
                    <li><strong>Three of a kind or full house:</strong><sup>*</sup> keep the white die if there are ≥ 2 lit indicators; otherwise, the black die if there are ≥ 2 unlit; otherwise, the highest value not in the three-of-a-kind.
                    <li><strong>Four of a kind or two pairs:</strong> keep any dice matching the number of batteries; otherwise, matching the number of battery holders; otherwise the yellow die.
                    <li><strong>Pair:</strong> keep the die of the color listed in the first applicable row of the following table:
                        <table>
                            <tr><th>If there is a...</th><th>Die color</th></tr>
                            <tr><th>parallel port<td>purple</tr>
                            <tr><th>PS/2 port    <td>blue  </tr>
                            <tr><th>RCA port     <td>white </tr>
                            <tr><th>RJ port      <td>black </tr>
                            <tr><th>otherwise    <td>yellow</tr>
                        </table>
                    <li><strong>Otherwise:</strong> you must roll all the dice again.
                    <li>In all of the above cases, dice of the same value as a die to be kept may also be kept.
                </ul>

                <div class='footnote'>
                    <p><strong>Yahtzee:</strong> All dice show the same value.</p>
                    <p><strong>Large straight:</strong> Five consecutive values.</p>
                    <p><strong>Small straight:</strong> Four consecutive values. The <strong>outlier</strong> is the fifth die.</p>
                    <p><strong>Three of a kind:</strong> Three dice of equal value, but not four.</p>
                    <p><strong>Full house:</strong> Three of a kind plus two of another kind.</p>
                    <p>These terms always refer to all of the dice, regardless of which were rolled and which were kept.</p>
