                <h2>On the Subject of Flashing Cube</h2>
                <p class="flavour-text">Hmm… two coprime, stacked sequences… interesting…</p>

                <p>On the module, there is a cube with five visible faces. 
                    Each face can be pressed once to reveal a cycle of symbols. 
                    <u>Do not press a face more than once until you are ready to submit.</u>
                </p>

                <p>The cube has a symbol on every side; each face displays its current symbol. 
                    After each rotation, each face will display a new symbol corresponding to two stacked sequences of rotations. 
                    One sequence has 2 rotations, and the other has 3 rotations. 
                    At each step, the current rotation of the shorter sequence and the current rotation of the longer sequence will be applied instantaneously, in that order.
                </p>

                <p>
                    To enter input mode, press the top face twice. 
                    Then, enter one of the sequences of rotations with the middle faces; left = X, front = Y, right = Z (rotations are named as in the
                    <a href="https://ktane.timwi.de/HTML/The%20Hypercube.html">Hypercube</a> manual:
                    a sequence “XY, then YZ” would be entered as XYYZ -> left, middle, middle, right). 
                    Then press the top face again to finalize that sequence’s input. 
                    Repeat with the bottom face to enter the second sequence.
                </p>

                <p>Once both sequences are inputted, press the front face twice to submit.</p>
