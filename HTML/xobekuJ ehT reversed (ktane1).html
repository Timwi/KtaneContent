                <p class="flavour-text">No copyright law in the universe can stop me!</p>
                <p>This module consists of three lanes, each with a string of letters, and a vinyl record player.
                <br>These three strings are three consecutive lyrics from a sample of one of the listed songs (ignoring punctuation and accents) that have been encrypted by random monoalphabetic substitution.</p>
                <p>Pressing the record will clear the text from the lanes and begin playing a reversed sample from which the lyrics can be found.
                <br>Once the sample has played in full (or been skipped by pressing the record while the sample is playing), the top and bottom lanes will be filled with randomised lettered keys and the middle lane of text will be replaced with question marks.</p>
                <p>The sample cannot be listened to again once it has played before submission.</p>
                <p>Using these keys, type the unencrypted second displayed lyric from right to left. Then, press the record again to submit.
                <br>Pressing the record before fully entering the word will clear the entry.</p>
