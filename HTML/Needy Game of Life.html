                <p>This module has a 4×4 grid. When the module activates, some LEDs will light up. To disarm the needy, input the correct next stage.</p>
                <p>
                    For every activation after the first, the LEDs will be set to the previous correct iteration until the module repeats an iteration or it goes completely black.
                    Less time will be provided for these until the module chooses a new random configuration or the module strikes. 
                    If the timer runs out or an incorrect solution is submitted, the module will strike, show what squares were incorrect, and deactivate.
                </p>
                <p>If the timer runs out, the needy will strike. If an incorrect solution is submitted, the module will strike and deactivate.</p>
                <p>The button on the left labelled ‘R’ is used to reset the grid to the state it was in when the needy activated. The button on the right labelled ‘S’ is used to submit the answer.</p>
                <p>A square is considered neighbouring if it is adjacent to another square, including diagonally.</p>
