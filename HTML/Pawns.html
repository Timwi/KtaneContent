                <p>The module will contain a display with two sets of chess pieces and their coordinates beside them. The selected pair is displayed through the LEDs on the right of the module and can be cycled using the arrow buttons.</p>
                  <p>Each set represents two pieces on a 7×7 chessboard. For each pair, if the left piece can capture the right piece within one move, press “capture.” Otherwise, press “pass.”</p>
                  <p>Note that pieces are able to block each other, and that no pieces disappear or move upon submitting an answer.</p>
                  <br>
                  <p>There will also be a number of other objects on the chessboard which can block movement. To obtain these coordinates, take the first letter and first digit of the serial number. Add or subtract 7 until both are within the range A–G or 1–7. This is the coordinate of the first blocker. Repeat this with the next letter and digit of the serial number until you run out of either.</p>
                  <p>Coordinates are notated using a letter and a number. The letter corresponds to a column from left to right, and the number corresponds to a row from bottom to top.</p>
