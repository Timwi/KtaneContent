          <h2>On the Subject of Bronco Trolleys</h2>
          <p class="flavour-text">One can only imagine how these must taste, especially with the orange peel…</p>
          <p>A bronco trolley is Homestar Runner's favorite after-school snack. It is made by spreading peanut butter on a Triscuit, and topping it with a slice of orange. Help him make as many bronco trolleys as possible by clicking on the Triscuit, the peanut butter, and then the orange. Work fast; you've only got 45 seconds. Up to 13 finished bronco trolleys will appear on the right side as you make them.</p>
          <p>At least 10 bronco trolleys should be made by default, but the number needed can be changed in the mod's settings to anywhere from 10 to 15.</p>
