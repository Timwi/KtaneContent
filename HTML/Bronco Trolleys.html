                <h2>On the Subject of Bronco Trolleys</h2>
                <p class="flavour-text">One can only imagine how these must taste, especially with the orange peel…</p>
                <p>
                    A bronco trolley is Homestar Runner’s favorite after-school snack.
                    It is made by spreading peanut butter on a Triscuit, and topping it with a slice of orange.
                    Help him make as many bronco trolleys as possible by clicking on the Triscuit, the peanut butter, and then the orange.
                    Work fast; you’ve only got 45 seconds.
                    Up to 13 finished bronco trolleys will appear on the right side as you make them.
                </p>
                <p>At least 10 bronco trolleys should be made by default, but the number needed can be changed in the mod’s settings to anywhere from 10 to 15.</p>
