                        <h2>On the Subject of ModBus</h2>
                        <p class="flavour-text">"I got this, I'm a professional" were his last words.</p>
                        
                        <p>The ModBus is a serial communications protocol originally published by Modicon in 1979, for use with its PLCs (Programmable Logic Controllers).</p>
						<p class="flavour-text">A little bit of History is good, right?</p>
						
						<br>
						
						<p>It's commonly used as means of connecting industrial electronic devices... and can be involved with making a bomb.<br>
						To defuse the module, it is simple. You only need to send the right frame.<br>
						Don't send anything before you are done writing the frame.</p>
						
						<p class="flavour-text">You just have to follow the instructions. As simple as cooking a turkey!</p>
						
						<br>
						
                        <h2>ModBus Protocol</h2>
						<p class="flavour-text">"READ THIS SECTION! please."</p>
						<p>Like we said before, you need to follow a strict protocol. We are lucky, bomb-makers never use CRC (Cyclic Redundancy Check, "Error check").<br>
						Furthermore, we know they only use the RTU frame format described below</p>
						
                        <img src="img/ModBus/frameModBus.png" width="500" />
						<p class="flavour-text">Like we said before, we don't need to calculate the CRC (lucky you).<br></p>
						<p>16 bit words (2 bytes) are sent in "Big endian" (Most Signifiant Bit First).<br>
						e.g. You have to send (42)<sub>DEC</sub> = (2A)<sub>HEX</sub>, so you need to send "2" then "A".</p>
						
						
						<h3>Address</h3>
						<p class="flavour-text">"Where do I have to enter the defusal code?"</p>
						<p>To find the address, you need to look at the first number (or letter) of the serial code on the bomb.<br>
						Convert it (they are all in ASCII) into a hexadecimal number (See Appendix ASCII table), this is the address (yay!).<p>
						<p class="flavour-text">Don't use numbers in decimal!</p>

                        <h3>Function</h3>
						<p class="flavour-text">"Hmm... I guess it's an important section..."</p>
						<p>Bomb-makers (or defusers, or someone else?) use only 2 functions:<p>
						<ol>
                            <li>Function 04, used to read a data word. (and Yes, we'll have to use it)</li>
                            <li>Function 06, used to write a data word.</li>
                        </ol>
						<p> The choice is simple, look at the last number (or letter) of the serial code.<br>
						Convert it into a decimal number. (they are all in ASCII)<br>
						THEN calculate this number modulo 4(e.g. : 12%4 = 0,&nbsp;&nbsp; 15%4 = 3)</p>
						<p class="flavour-text">"Simple, right?"</p>
						<br>
						<p>After that, multiply it by 3, and calculate the result modulo 2<br>
						If the result is ...</p>
						<ol>
                            <li>&nbsp;...0, use function 04.</li>
                            <li>&nbsp;...1, use function 06.</li>
                        </ol>
						<h3>Function 04</h3>
						<p class="flavour-text">Read data, defuse the module, be a hero. BOOM dream achieved.</p>
						<p>Bomb-makers developed a new kind of protection. Instead of using the write function to defuse their module, You only need to read the right data on the module using function 04.<br></p>
							<p class="flavour-text">Don't care about it.</p>
							<br>
							<p>So, How is the data area composed? (Read the tab below)</p>	
						<img src="img/ModBus/FrameFunction04.png" width="400" />
						<p class="flavour-text">You see, it's the last 4 bytes to find! Keep calm and defuse it!</p>

						<h4>Address of the word</h4>
						<p>First, to find the word address, multiply the third digit by the fourth digit.<br>
							Convert letters into decimal using the appendix ASCII table.<br>
							Don't change numbers like above, take the number write (If it's write 5 take 5).<br>
							Next, multiply the result by 100.<br>
							Then, just take the two least significant bytes. <br>
							i.e. : (45BA72C)<SUB>HEX</SUB> -> (A72C)<SUB>HEX</SUB><br></p>
						<h4>The number of words to read</h4>	
						<p>Hmmm, you might think, "I will read 210 words, that's nonsense!", and I will tell you, Yes.<br>
							BUT, it does not work like that, bomb-makers use this function sneakily, so they don't use it's real purpose.<br>
							Please find those last 2 bytes (even if they don't relate to anything).<br>
							<br>
							Take the address of the slave (decimal), multiply by the the number of function (4 or 6) then add the data number (decimal too).<br>
							Convert the result into Hexadecimal, simplify like just before. And you got it!<br>
							<br>
							Send the data and you will be a hero (or not if you failed).<br></p>

						<h3>Function 06</h3>
						<p class="flavour-text"> Be careful, the keyboard is stronger than the sword!</p>
						<p>You previously determine the slave address and the function "write". <br>
							But now you need to find what you need to write, and where (in the slave memory)? <br>
							See below for how the data area is composed when you want to write something.
						<img src="img/ModBus/FrameFunction06.png" width="400" />
						<p class="flavour-text">I believe in you! You got this!</p>

						<h4>Address in the register</h4>
						<p>I hope you reviewed your binary operations because you will use them! (It's not a joke).<br>
							First step, take the 4th number (or letter, they are all ASCII), convert it with the ASCII table (in binary this time).<br>
							When you've got the number, fill the rest of the 16 bits with 0 to convert it into the same number in 16 bits. example : 101 = 0000 0101 (for 8 bits).<br>
							You have to invert this number (NOT Operation), truth table below:</p>
						<table style="text-align: center;">
							<tr>
								<th>A</th>
								<th>NOT A</th>
							</tr>
							<tr>
								<td>1</td>
								<td>0</td>
							</tr>
							<tr>
								<td>0</td>
								<td>1</td>
							</tr>
						</table>
						<p>You just have to convert the 16 bits binary number into an decimal number.<br>
							Simplify by cut the higher value. i.e. : 265486 -> 5486 <br>
							Annnnndddd, you have the address in the register.</p>
						
						<h4>Value</h4>
						<p>The last part is the easiest! To find the value to enter at this address, take the first digit of the serial number (in decimal) and subtract the number of function.<br>
							Then multiply this result by the 5th digit of the serial number (or letter, again in decimal) and simplify like above.</p>
						<p>If you there, and you think it's finished, and yes, it's finished! <br>
							Now, enter all the parameters in the right order, and click on the send button.<br>
							YOU DID IT MY BOY!</p>
