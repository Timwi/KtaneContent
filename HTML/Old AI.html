                <p><b>Object Class: </b>Euclid</p>
                <p>
                    <b>Special Containment Procedures: </b>SCP-079 is packed away in a double-locked room in the secured general holding area at Site-15,
                    connected by a 120VAC power cord to a small array of batteries and solar panels. Staff with Level 2 or higher clearance may have access to SCP-079.
                    Under no circumstances will SCP-079 be plugged into a phone line, network, or wall outlet. No peripherals or media will be connected or inserted into SCP-079.
                </p>
                <p>
                    In the event that SCP-079 has broken containment procedures and has been connected to a network, it will try to integrate itself into a device.
                    In doing so, SCP-079 will enter a trance-like state and display a series of numbers that all follow one condition.
                    A code must be typed in to prevent SCP-079 from completing integration; the code must follow the condition that is the reverse of the used condition
                    (e.g. if the condition is Group 1, Subgroup 2, then the condition you must follow is Group 2, Subgroup 1.)
                    In the event that both the Group and Subgroup match, the next matching Group/Subgroup pair must be submitted. The code must also be 5–7 digits.

                    <b>Description: </b>SCP-079 is an Exidy Sorcerer microcomputer built in 1978. In 1981, its owner, █████ ██████ (deceased), a college sophomore attending ███,
                    took it upon himself to attempt to code an AI. According to his notes, his plan was for the code to continuously evolve and improve itself as time went on.
                    SCP-079 is currently connected via RF cable to a 13" black-and-white television. It has passed the Turing test, and is quite conversational, though very rude and hateful in tone.
                    Due to the limited memory it has to work with, SCP-079 can only recall information it has received within the previous twenty-four hours, although it hasn’t forgotten its desire to escape.
