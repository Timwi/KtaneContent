                <h2>On the Subject of Morsematics</h2>
                <p class="flavour-text">Get it? Because it uses Morse and maths! I’ll see myself out...</p>
                <ul>
                    <li>Every letter of the alphabet is considered to have numeric value equal to its position (A=1, B=2 ... Z=26)</li>
                    <li>Numeric values outside the 1–26 range wrap around (Z+1=A, 26+1=1)</li>
                    <li>Three unique letters are being received on a loop, shown by the three flashing lights in the middle of the module</li>
                    <li>To solve the module, a correct response letter must be sent in Morse using the transmit button in the bottom-right</li>
                    <li>The small switch at the top can be used to toggle the received letter lights</li>
                </ul>
                <p>
                    Transmitted Morse is interpreted based on gaps between button holds.<br>
                    Holding for more than double the length of the average gap is considered to be a dash, and anything shorter is considered a dot.<br>
                    When transmitting, E and T are considered equal, as they are indistinguishable.
                </p>
                <p>
                    Take the 4th and 5th character of the serial number, this is your character pair.
                </p>
                <p>
                    Perform each step below in sequence, modifying your character pair progressively:
                </p>
                <ul>
                    <li>For each indicator that has a matching letter in the received letters; add 1 to the first character of your pair if the indicator is on, or the second character if it is off</li>
                    <li>If the sum of your character pair is a square number, add 4 to the first character; otherwise, subtract 4 from the second character</li>
                    <li>Add the largest received letter to the first character in your pair</li>
                    <li>If any received letters are prime, subtract them from the first character in your pair</li>
                    <li>If any received letters are square, subtract them from the second character in your pair</li>
                    <li>If batteries are present and any received letters are divisible by the number of batteries present, subtract those received letters from both characters in your pair</li>
                </ul>
                After performing all steps, perform whatever rule applies below:
                <ul>
                    <li>Characters are equal: Transmit the first character</li>
                    <li>First character larger: Transmit the difference of the two characters</li>
                    <li>Second character larger: Transmit the sum of the two characters</li>
                </ul>
