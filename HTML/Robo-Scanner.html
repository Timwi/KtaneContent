                <h2>On the Subject of Robo-Scanner</h2>
                <p class="flavour-text">The robots have taken all jobs left in the world, including fabrication of explosives.</p>
                <p>This module contains a display, 4 arrow buttons, a button with a display on it, and a “SUB” button.</p>
                <p>The display is the viewport of a scanner. This scanner is perched above a 5×5 grid of cells which are being navigated to and from by different colored robots. One of these cells the robots will never go to, find out which cell this is by using the scanner. The scanner can be moved around by holding the arrow buttons. <em>Note that the borders around each cell are invisible and the scanner will not be allowed to leave the grid.</em></p>
                <p>The movement speed of the scanner has 3 different settings: 1 is the slowest speed, 2 is a medium speed, and 3 is the highest speed. The current speed setting will be displayed on the button with a display, and the setting can be changed by pressing that button.</p>
                <p>Once the cell is found use the cell’s position in the <b>D1AGR4M</b> on the next page to get a sequence of 4 directions that must be submitted to solve the module. To submit this sequence, first press the “SUB” button to enter submission mode. Then press the arrow buttons corresponding to these directions to input them. The inputted sequence will be submitted automatically once the 4th direction is inputted. If a mistake is made during input, press the “SUB” button again to exit submission mode and reset all inputs.</p>
                <p>If the submitted sequence is incorrect a strike will be recorded and the module will exit submission mode.</p>
