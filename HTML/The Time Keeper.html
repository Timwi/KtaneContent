                        <h2>On the Subject of The Time Keeper</h2>
                        <p class="flavour-text">I just need a few more seconds, okay?</p>
                        <ul>
                          <li>You are presented with a digital display and 3 colored LEDs. Based on the colors of the LEDs, the color of the digits, the number displayed, and some other information provided on the bomb, you must decide when to click which LED.</li>
                          <li>The LEDs will be refered to in the order they appear in standard reading order.</li>
                          <li>You only need to click one LED to solve the module.</li>
                          <li>LEDs and the displayed number will each be in one of the following colors: Red, Yellow, Blue, Green, Black, or White.</li>
                          <li>Starting with the displayed number, adjust it using the following steps in the order they appear.</li>
                          <li>If at any time you are told which LED you need to click, that is final. Disredard any further instructions on which LED to click.</li>
                          <li>Whenever you reach an endpoint (marked <span style="color:darkred;">END</span>), stop following the steps, the number you now have is your final number.</li>
                          <li>Once you have your final number and LED to click (if an LED has not been selected by any of the steps prior to your endpoint, refer to the <span style="text-decoration:underline;">Deciding on an LED</span> section on page 3),
                            click the correct LED when the number of seconds remaining on the bomb* is equal to your final number (within 2 seconds above or below - ex. if your number is 70, clicking anywhere between 1m08s and 1m12s left is acceptable). If the bomb contains a total of less seconds remaining than your final number, divide your number by two (rounding down to the nearest whole second). Continue to do this until
                            your number is less than the total time remaining on the bomb (ex. if your number is 70 but there are only 43 seconds left on the bomb, clicking at 35, 17, 8, 4, 2, or 1 would be accepted). Note: This module does not like to wait. If you press an LED with less than 10 seconds remaining on the bomb, you will recieve a strike regardless of whether or not the time you pressed is acceptable. The module will still be passed, however, if the time you clicked on is acceptable.</li>
                          <li>If you are told to add a letter to your number, add the letter's corresponding numeric value (A=1, B=2, etc.). Ex. 23 + D = 27</li>
                        </ul>

                        <p style="font-size:0.65em">*This is not the number displayed in the "seconds" position on the timer. This is the total time remaining, in seconds. Ex. 1m20s = 80s. If your number is 80, you would click the correct LED when the timer displays
                          01:20.</p>

                        <li>Add 2 for every lit indicator and subtract 3 for every unlit indicator.</li>
                        <li>If the third LED, the first LED, and the displayed number are the same color but the second LED is a different color, the LED you need to press is the third one and <span style="color:darkred;">END</span>.</li>
                        <li>If you applied rule 9, add 10. Otherwise, subtract 19.</li>

                        <li>If by adding up the total number of letters in the name of the color of all three LEDs is greater than 13, add the number equal to the total number of letters in the name of the color of the displayed number.</li>

                        <li>The LED you must press is the one whose color's name has the most letters, unless there is an indicator labeled FRK present on the bomb or there is a tie between two LEDs; if this is the case, disregard this rule.</li>
                        <li>Add the numeric value of the first letter in all of the unlit indicators. If there are none, multiply by 3.</li>
