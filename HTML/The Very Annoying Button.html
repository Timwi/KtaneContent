                    <h2>On the Subject of The Very Annoying Button</h2>
                    <p class="flavour-text">Good luck trying to get anything done.</p>
                <p>This module consists of a hatch with a button behind it and a counter that resets approximately every ten seconds.</p>
				<p>When the counter resets, there is a chance that the hatch will open, revealing a button in one of four colours.<br>
				<strong>The module does not give an audio indication when this occurs.</strong></p>
				<p>The button must be pressed before the module resets again.</p>
				<p>When the button is pressed, the number of seconds remaining on the counter before the next reset is due is recorded.<br>
				   When the counter resets, the recorded value is submitted and the hatch will close.</p>
				<p>The validity of the submitted value depends on the colour of the button:</p>
				<table>
				<tr><th>If the button is...</th><th>..., DO NOT press the button when the number of seconds remaining on the counter is...</td></th>
				<tr><th>red</th><th>greater than 5</th></tr>
				<tr><th>yellow</th><th>even</th></tr>
				<tr><th>green</th><th>a multiple of 3 or 5</th></tr>
				<tr><th>blue</th><th>prime</th></tr>
				</table>
				<p>In addition, the module keeps track of the most recent valid submission for each colour.<br>
				   These values must also be avoided when the button is pressed.</p>
				<p>Once the time remaining on the bomb drops below one minute or there are no other unsolved modules on the bomb, this module becomes solvable on its next reset.<br>
				   In this state, the hatch will not close and strikes cannot be incurred from resets without submission.<br>
				   A valid submission in this state will solve the module.</p>
