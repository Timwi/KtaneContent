                <h2>On the Subject of Bomb Corp. Filing Holdable</h2>
                <p class="flavour-text">Oh hey, this little holdable came pre-installed with the Bomb Corp. office!</p>

                <p>This holdable sits on the desk in the Bomb Corp. Office mod. You don't have to mess with it. However, if you choose to do so, the instructions are easy.</p>
                <p>Simply sort the module names in the order described at the top of the module. For example, if the instructions are "Sort module names from A to Z," you'd sort Abstract Sequences before Bamboozled Again, Bamboozled Again before Caesar Cipher, and so on.</p>
                <h3>Mistakes</h3>
                <p>If you make a mistake, you can still keep going. Simply file the module that should have come next. It will replace the module you just (incorrectly) filed.</p>
                <h3>Sorting Rules:</h3>
                <p>(Reverse these for Z-A.)</p>
                <ul>
                    <li>Numbers come first. "14" would be sorted before "Alphabet Tiles." A-Z = 0-9</li>
                    <li>Modules that have special characters like percent signs will not be included in the holdable, for simplicity. (I'm looking at you, % Gray and ...?)</li>
                    <li>Nothing comes before something. "Dungeon," with nothing after it, would come before "Dungeon 2nd Floor."</li>
                    <li>And obviously, if two modules start with the same letter, sort by the second letter. If that's the same, sort by the third letter, and so on.</li>
                </ul>
                <p>By the way, the module names are pulled from the modules that YOU currently have installed. Don't have any modded modules installed? Don't worry! While the holdable prioritizes using modded module names for more variety, it will fall back to vanilla module names if it needs to.</p>
