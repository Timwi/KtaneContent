                <h2>On the Subject of Button Messer</h2>
                <p class="flavour-text">Please don't kill me for this!</p>
                <p>On startup, the module has nothing visual. However, if there's more of it on the bomb, all of them except for 1 will have a "Solve" button which solves the module when clicked.</p>
                <p>When you click a button on any other module*, it will seemingly do nothing. But on the active Button Messer, a grey rectangle will show up with the image of a button of another module on it.</p>
                <p>The grey rectangle represents the module which has its button shown. (Position of the button on the rectangle is the same as its position on its module)</p>
                <p>When you click on the shown button on its module, that button will work like it should. But if it wasn't pressed before, the Button Messer module will show a new button.</p>
                <p>This module will solve when every button on the bomb was pressed at least on time.</p>
                <p><strong>Note: </strong>When a Button Messer is active, no buttons will strike on their first press! (Every other action will run, unless it's not yet unlocked.)</p>
                <p>*There are modules ignored by Button Messer.</p>
