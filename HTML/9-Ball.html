                    <h2>On the Subject of 9-Ball</h2>
                    <p class="flavour-text">Where are the pockets? How are the balls defying gravity? WHERE'S THE POOL CUE?</p>

                    <p>This module presents an array of billiard balls in a diamond formation. The 9 ball will always be central in the formation and the 1 ball will always be at the head, however the positioning of the other balls is uncertain. To solve the module you must win a game of 9-Ball according to certain rules. Potting a ball out of turn will cause a strike and reset the module.</p>

                    <h3>Step 1: Breaking the Formation</h3>

                    <p>As every good billiards game begins, you need to break the formation. However, there are certain rules that determine which balls are potted during the break which are listed below (with A being the first ball in reading order, skipping over 1 and 9):</p>

                    <ul>
                    <li>A - If this ball is greater than 5.</li>
                    <li>B - If ball A is greater than this one.</li>
                    <li>C - If this ball is greater than the last digit of the serial number.</li>
                    <li>D - If this ball is prime.</li>
                    <li>E - If either of the adjacent balls (excluding 9) are consecutive in value to this ball.</li>
                    <li>F - If the difference of the adjacent balls (excluding 1 and 9) is greater than 2.</li>
                    <li>G - If neither of the adjacent balls (excluding 1 and 9) is greater than 6.</li>
                    <li>1 - If the last digit of the serial number is odd.</li>
                    <li>9 - Never.</li>
                    </ul>

                    <p>In this step, order has no significance meaning that the valid balls can be potted in any order.</p>

                    <h3>Step 2: After the Break</h3>

                    <p>After the break, the remaining balls should be potted in ascending numerical order, ending with the 9 ball.</p>
