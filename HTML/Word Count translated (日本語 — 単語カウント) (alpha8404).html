                    Two households, both alike in dignity, In fair Verona, where we lay our scene, From ancient grudge break to new mutiny, Where civil blood makes civil hands unclean. From forth the fatal loins of these two foes A pair of star-cross’d lovers take their life; Whose misadventured piteous overthrows Do with their death bury their parents’ strife. The fearful passage of their death-mark’d love, And the continuance of their parents’ rage, Which, but their children’s end, nought could remove, Is now the two hours’ traffic of our stage; The which if you with patient ears attend, What here shall 
                    <em>miss,</em> our toil shall strive to mend. Gregory, o’ my word, we’ll not carry coals. No, for then we should be colliers. I mean, an we be in choler, we’ll draw. Ay, while you live, draw your neck out o’ the collar. I strike quickly, being moved. But thou art not quickly moved to strike. A dog of the house of Montague moves me. To move is to stir; and to be valiant is to stand: therefore, if thou art moved, thou runn’st away. A dog of that house shall move me to stand: I will take the wall of 
                    <em>any</em> man or maid of Montague’s. That shows thee a weak slave; for the weakest goes to the wall. True; and therefore women, being the weaker vessels, are ever thrust to the wall: therefore I will push Montague’s men from the wall, and thrust his maids to the wall. The quarrel is between our masters and us their men. ‘Tis all one, I will show myself a tyrant: when I have fought with the men, I will be cruel with the maids, and cut off their heads. The heads of the maids? Ay, the heads of the maids, or their 
                    <em>maidenheads;</em> take it in what sense thou wilt. They must take it in sense that feel it. Me they shall feel while I am able to stand: and ‘tis known I am a pretty piece of flesh. ‘Tis well thou art not fish; if thou hadst, thou hadst been poor John. Draw thy tool! here comes two of the house of the Montagues. My naked weapon is out: quarrel, I will back thee. How! turn thy back and run? Fear me not. No, marry; I fear thee! Let us take the law of our sides; let them begin. I will 
                    <em>frown</em> as I pass by, and let them take it as they list. Nay, as they dare. I will bite my thumb at them; which is a disgrace to them, if they bear it. Do you bite your thumb at us, sir? I do bite my thumb, sir. Do you bite your thumb at us, sir? Is the law of our side, if I say ay? No. No, sir, I do not bite my thumb at you, sir, but I bite my thumb, sir. Do you quarrel, sir? Quarrel sir! no, sir. If you do, sir, I am for you:
                    <em>I</em> serve as good a man as you. No better. Well, sir. Say ‘better:’ here comes one of my master’s kinsmen. Yes, better, sir. You lie. Draw, if you be men. Gregory, remember thy swashing blow. Part, fools! Put up your swords; you know not what you do. What, art thou drawn among these heartless hinds? Turn thee, Benvolio, look upon thy death. I do but keep the peace: put up thy sword, Or manage it to part these men with me. What, drawn, and talk of peace! I hate the word, As I hate hell, all Montagues, and thee: 
                    <em>Have</em> at thee, coward! Clubs, bills, and partisans! strike! beat them down! Down with the Capulets! down with the Montagues! What noise is this? Give me my long sword, ho! A crutch, a crutch! why call you for a sword? My sword, I say! Old Montague is come, And flourishes his blade in spite of me. Thou villain Capulet, Hold me not, let me go. Thou shalt not stir a foot to seek a foe. Rebellious subjects, enemies to peace, Profaners of this neighbour-stained steel, Will they not hear? What, ho! you men, you beasts, That quench the fire of 
                    <em>your</em> pernicious rage With purple fountains issuing from your veins, On pain of torture, from those bloody hands Throw your mistemper’d weapons to the ground, And hear the sentence of your moved prince. Three civil brawls, bred of an airy word, By thee, old Capulet, and Montague, Have thrice disturb’d the quiet of our streets, And made Verona’s ancient citizens Cast by their grave beseeming ornaments, To wield old partisans, in hands as old, Canker’d with peace, to part your canker’d hate: If ever you disturb our streets again, Your lives shall pay the forfeit of the peace. For this 
                    <em>time,</em> all the rest depart away: You Capulet; shall go along with me: And, Montague, come you this afternoon, To know our further pleasure in this case, To old Free-town, our common judgment-place. Once more, on pain of death, all men depart. Who set this ancient quarrel new abroach? Speak, nephew, were you by when it began? Here were the servants of your adversary, And yours, close fighting ere I did approach: I drew to part them: in the instant came The fiery Tybalt, with his sword prepared, Which, as he breathed defiance to my ears, He swung about his 
                    <em>head</em> and cut the winds, Who nothing hurt withal hiss’d him in scorn: While we were interchanging thrusts and blows, Came more and more and fought on part and part, Till the prince came, who parted either part. O, where is Romeo? saw you him to-day? Right glad I am he was not at this fray. Madam, an hour before the worshipp’d sun Peer’d forth the golden window of the east, A troubled mind drave me to walk abroad; Where, underneath the grove of sycamore That westward rooteth from the city’s side, So early walking did I see your son:

                    According to all known laws of aviation, there is no way a bee should be able to fly. Its wings are too small to get its fat little body off the ground. The bee, of course, flies anyway because bees don’t care what humans think is impossible. Yellow, black. Yellow, black. Yellow, black. Yellow, black. Ooh, black and yellow! Let’s shake it up a little. Barry! Breakfast is ready! Coming! Hang on a second. Hello? Barry? Adam? Can you believe this is happening? I can’t. I’ll pick you up. Looking sharp. Use the stairs. Your father paid good money 
                    <em>for</em> those. Sorry. I’m excited. Here’s the graduate. We’re very proud of you, son. A perfect report card, all B’s. Very proud. Ma! I got a thing going here. You got lint on your fuzz. Ow! That’s me! Wave to us! We’ll be in row 118,000. Bye! Barry, I told you, stop flying in the house! Hey, Adam. Hey, Barry. Is that fuzz gel? A little. Special day, graduation. Never thought I’d make it. Three days grade school, three days high school. Those were awkward. Three days college. I’m glad I took a day and hitchhiked around the hive. You
                    <em>did</em> come back different. Hi, Barry. Artie, growing a mustache? Looks good. Hear about Frankie? Yeah. You going to the funeral? No, I’m not going. Everybody knows, sting someone, you die. Don’t waste it on a squirrel. Such a hothead. I guess he could have just gotten out of the way. I love this incorporating an amusement park into our day. That’s why we don’t need vacations. Boy, quite a bit of pomp under the circumstances. Well, Adam, today we are men. We are! Bee men. Amen! Hallelujah! Students, faculty, distinguished bees, please welcome Dean Buzzwell. Welcome, New Hive City 
                    <em>graduating</em> class of 9:15. That concludes our ceremonies. And begins your career at Honex Industries! Will we pick our job today? I heard it’s just orientation. Heads up! Here we go. Keep your hands and antennas inside the tram at all times. Wonder what it’ll be like? A little scary. Welcome to Honex, a division of Honesco and a part of the Hexagon Group. This is it! Wow. Wow. We know that you, as a bee, have worked your whole life to get to the point where you can work for your whole life. Honey begins when our valiant Pollen
                    <em>Jocks</em> bring the nectar to the hive. Our top secret formula is automatically color corrected, scent adjusted and bubble contoured into this soothing sweet syrup with its distinctive golden glow you know as Honey! That girl was hot. She’s my cousin! She is? Yes, we’re all cousins. Right. You’re right. At Honex, we constantly strive to improve every aspect of bee existence. These bees are stress testing a new helmet technology. What do you think he makes? Not enough. Here we have our latest advancement, the Krelman. What does that do? Catches that little strand of honey that hangs after 
                    <em>you</em> pour it. Saves us millions. Can anyone work on the Krelman? Of course. Most bee jobs are small ones. But bees know that every small job, if it’s done well, means a lot. But choose carefully because you’ll stay in the job you pick for the rest of your life. The same job the rest of your life? I didn’t know that. What’s the difference? You’ll be happy to know that bees, as a species, haven’t had one day off in 27 million years. So you’ll just work us to death? We’ll sure try. Wow! That blew my mind! 
                    <em>What’s</em> the difference? How can you say that? One job forever? That’s an insane choice to have to make. I’m relieved. Now we only have to make one decision in life. But, Adam, how could they never have told us that? Why would you question anything? We’re bees. We’re the most perfectly functioning society on Earth. You ever think maybe things work a little too well here? Like what? Give me one example. I don’t know. But you know what I’m talking about. Please clear the gate. Royal Nectar Force on approach. Wait a second. Check it out. Hey, those 
                    <em>are</em> Pollen Jocks! Wow. I’ve never seen them this close. They know what it’s like outside the hive. Yeah, but some don’t come back. Hey, Jocks! Hi, Jocks! You guys did great! You’re monsters! You’re sky freaks! I love it! I love it! I wonder where they were. I don’t know. Their day’s not planned. Outside the hive, flying who knows where, doing who knows what. You can’t just decide to be a Pollen Jock. You have to be bred for that. Right. Look. That’s more pollen than you and I will see in a lifetime. It’s just a status 
                    <em>symbol</em>. Bees make too much of it. Perhaps. Unless you’re wearing it and the ladies see you wearing it. Those ladies? Aren’t they our cousins too? Distant. Distant. Look at these two. Couple of Hive Harrys. Let’s have fun with them. It must be dangerous being a Pollen Jock. Yeah. Once a bear pinned me against a mushroom! He had a paw on my throat, and with the other, he was slapping me! Oh, my! I never thought I’d knock him out. What were you doing during this? Trying to alert the authorities. I can autograph that. A little gusty 
                    <em>out</em> there today, wasn’t it, comrades? Yeah. Gusty. We’re hitting a sunflower patch six miles from here tomorrow. Six miles, huh? Barry! A puddle jump for us, but maybe you’re not up for it. Maybe I am. You are not! We’re going 0900 at J Gate. What do you think, buzzy boy? Are you bee enough? I might be. It all depends on what 0900 means. Hey, Honex! Dad, you surprised me. You decide what you’re interested in? Well, there’s a lot of choices. But you only get one. Do you ever get bored doing the same job every day?

                    You can get anything you want at Alice’s restaurant You can get anything you want at Alice’s restaurant Walk right in, it’s around the back Just a half a mile from the railroad track You can get anything you want at Alice’s restaurant This song is called “Alice’s Restaurant” It’s about Alice, and the Restaurant, but “Alice’s Restaurant” is not the name of the restaurant, That’s just the name of the song That’s why I call the song “Alice’s Restaurant.” Now it all started two Thanksgivings ago, two years ago, on Thanksgiving, When my friend and I went up 
                    <em>to</em> visit Alice at the restaurant But Alice doesn’t live in the restaurant, she lives in the church nearby the Restaurant, in the bell tower with her husband Ray and Facha, the dog And livin’ in the bell tower like that, they got a lot of room downstairs Where the pews used to be, and having all that room (seeing as how they took out all the pews), they decided that they didn’t have to take out their Garbage for a long time. We got up here and found all the garbage in there and we decided that it’d Be 
                    <em>a</em> friendly gesture for us to take the garbage down to the city dump So we took the half a ton of garbage, put it in the back of a red VW Microbus, took shovels and rakes and implements of destruction, and headed On toward the city dump. Well, we got there and there was a big sign and a Chain across the dump sayin’, “this dump is closed on Thanksgiving,” and We’d never heard of a dump closed on Thanksgiving before, and with tears in Our eyes, we drove off into the sunset looking for another place to put 
                    <em>the</em> garbage We didn’t find one till we came to a side road, and off the side of the side Road was another fifteen foot cliff, and at the bottom of the cliff was Another pile of garbage. And we decided that one big pile was better than Two little piles, and rather than bring that one up, we decided to throw Ours down. That’s what we did Drove back to the church, had a Thanksgiving dinner that couldn’t be beat, Went to sleep, and didn’t get up until the next morning, when we got a phone Call from Officer 
                    <em>Obie.</em> He said, “kid, we found your name on a envelope at The bottom of a half a ton of garbage and I just wanted to know if you had Any information about it” And I said, “yes sir, Officer Obie, I cannot tell a lie. I put that envelope Under that garbage.” After speaking to Obie for about forty five minutes on The telephone, we finally arrived at the truth of the matter and he said That we had to go down and pick up the garbage, and also had to go down and Speak to him at the 
                    <em>Police</em> Officer Station. So we got in the red VW microbus With the shovels and rakes and implements of destruction and headed on Toward the Police Officer Station Now, friends, there was only one of two things that Obie could’ve done at The Police Officer Station, and the first was that he could’ve given us a Medal for being so brave and honest on the telephone (which wasn’t very Likely, and we didn’t expect it), and the other thing was that he could’ve Bawled us out and told us never to be seen drivin’ garbage around in the Vicinity again, 
                    <em>which</em> is what we expected But when we got to the Police Officer Station, there was a third possibility That we hadn’t even counted upon, and we was both immediately arrested, Handcuffed, and I said, “Obie, I can’t pick up the garbage with these here Handcuffs on.” He said “shut up kid, and get in the back of the patrol car” And that’s what we did, sat in the back of the patrol car, and drove to The quote scene of the crime unquote I want to tell you ‘bout the town of Stockbridge, Massachusetts, where this is Happening’. They 
                    <em>got</em> three stop signs, two police officers, and one police Car, but when we got to the scene of the crime, there was five police officers and three police cars, bein’ the biggest crime of the last fifty Years and everybody wanted to get in the newspaper story about it And they was using up all kinds of cop equipment that they had hangin’ Around the Police Officer Station. They was takin’ plaster tire tracks, Footprints, dog smelling’ prints and they took twenty seven 8x10 colored Glossy photographs with circles and arrows and a paragraph on the back of Each 
                    <em>one</em> explaining’ what each one was, to be used as evidence against us Took pictures of the approach, the getaway, the northwest corner, the Southwest corner And that’s not to mention the aerial photography! After the ordeal, we went back to the jail. Obie said he was gonna put us in a cell He said “kid, I’m gonna put you in a cell I want your wallet and your belt” I said, “Obie, I can understand your wantin’ my wallet, so I don’t have any Money to spend in the cell, but what do you want my belt for?” and 
                    <em>he</em> said “Kid, we don’t want any hangin’s I said, “Obie, did you think I was gonna Hang myself for litterin’?” Obie said he was making sure, and, friends, Obie was, ‘cause he took out the Toilet seat so I couldn’t hit myself over the head and drown, and he took Out the toilet paper so I couldn’t bend the bars, roll the toilet paper out The window, slide down the roll and have an escape. Obie was making sure It was about four or five hours later that Alice (remember Alice? There’s a song about Alice) Alice came by

                    This module consists of a screen, eight dials with red labels, and a QWERTY keyboard. The labels on the dials, when decrypted and read from left to right, spell out an eight letter word. The word has been encrypted through a series of ciphers, indicated by the direction each dial is pointing, from left to right. Once deciphered, find the word in the table below, the word written below it is the word that should be entered. Apply the same sequence of encryptions to the response word, and type out the encrypted response word using the keys. The word 
                    <em>is</em> automatically submitted when eight keys are pressed. The red button can be pressed at any time before the eighth key is pressed to cancel the input. Inputting any of the eight letters incorrectly will cause a strike to be issued and reset the module. Note: Unless stated otherwise, any reference to a letter’s alphabetic position starts at A equals 1. Similarly, any reference to the position of a dial starts from the leftmost dial equals 1. For each dial: if the number of 45 degree rotations, starting from north, is odd, then the bit given by the dial is 
                    <em>1.</em> Otherwise, it is 0. Form four pairs of bits by grouping the bits corresponding to adjacent pairs of dials from left to right. Form another four pair of bits by grouping the bits corresponding to adjacent pairs of dials in reading order. Each of the eight pairs of bits correspond to each of the eight dials from left to right. Using the operator corresponding to the position of the north pointing dial, find the truth values of each pair; the encrypted letter depends on whether each is true or false. Each letter in the word is swapped with the 
                    <em>letter</em> with the same alphabetic position in the reversed alphabet. That is, a letter with alphabetic position X will become the letter with alphabetic position 27 minus X. If the LED below the north pointing dial is lit, the Atbash cipher is applied to the input of the Logic cipher. Otherwise, the Atbash cipher is applied to the output of the Logic cipher. Each letter in the word has been shifted forwards through the alphabet by the number of 45 degree clockwise rotations, starting from north, to the direction its corresponding dial is pointing. If the LED corresponding to this 
                    <em>dial</em> is lit, each letter is then shifted further by the position of the dial corresponding to this cipher. Otherwise, each letter is then shifted backwards through the alphabet by the position of the dial corresponding to this cipher. The indexing of the lists start at zero. If the last dial is pointing east, use the word corresponding to the number of 45 degree rotations, starting from north, of the first dial. Otherwise, the number of 45 degree rotations, starting from north, of the next dial corresponds to which of the words in the lists below is the keyword for 
                    <em>this</em> cipher. If there are less than three unique ports on the bomb, use the keyword from List A. Otherwise, use the keyword from List B. The keyword gives the first ten letters or top two rows of the keysquare. If the LED corresponding to this cipher is unlit, the keyword is entered into the keysquare in reading order. Otherwise, the keyword is entered into the keysquare in reverse reading order. The remaining 15 letters fill the rest of the keysquare in alphabetical order, excluding X, which is never used. The word is split into four pairs of letters. Each 
                    <em>pair</em> of letters is altered: If both letters are the same, the encrypted pair is two of the letter diametrically opposite in the keysquare. Otherwise, if both letters belong to the same row of the keysquare, shift both letters one space to the right along the row. Otherwise, if both letters belong to the same column of the keysquare, shift both letters once space down the column. Otherwise, the letters lie on diagonally opposite corners of a rectangle, the encrypted pair consists of the letters in the horizontally opposite corners from the original pair. If the pair of letters is 
                    <em>XX,</em> the pair is unchanged by the cipher. If the pair of letters is either XY or YX, where Y is not X, the X is changed to the other letter, forming a double letter pair, and enciphered normally. Then, the new letter is changed back to an X. Each letter is translated using one of the two pigpen ciphers below. Starting from north, the pigpen characters are rotated to face the direction the dial is pointing. The rotated pigpen characters are then translated back, as though they are still facing north, to produce the encrypted letter. If the LED 
                    <em>corresponding</em> to this cipher is unlit, use cipher I. Otherwise, use cipher II. The indexing of the lists start at 0. For this cipher, the leftmost dial has a position of 0. The two lists give the keywords for two 5x5 keysquares, the keyword from List A is used for the first keysquare and the keyword from List B is used for the second: If the numbers in the serial number add up to more than 9, the keyword in List A is given by the position of dial and the keyword in List B is given by the number 
                    <em>of</em> 45 degree rotations, starting from north, of the previous dial. Otherwise, the keyword in List B is given by the position of dial and the keyword in List A is given by the number of 45 degree rotations, starting from north, of the previous dial. If the first dial is pointing south, the ‘previous’ dial is the last dial. These keywords are used to construct two cipher alphabets where each keyword precedes the remaining sixteen letters. For each letter, from left to right, consider the status of the LED below the dial in its position: If the status of

                    In the beginning God created the heaven and the earth. And the earth was without form, and void; and darkness was upon the face of the deep. And the Spirit of God moved upon the face of the waters. And God said, Let there be light and there was light. And God saw the light, that it was good and God divided the light from the darkness. And God called the light Day, and the darkness he called Night. And the evening and the morning were the first day. And God said, Let there be a firmament in the 
                    <em>midst</em> of the waters, and let it divide the waters from the waters. And God made the firmament, and divided the waters which were under the firmament from the waters which were above the firmament and it was so. And God called the firmament Heaven. And the evening and the morning were the second day. And God said, Let the waters under the heaven be gathered together unto one place, and let the dry land appear and it was so. And God called the dry land Earth; and the gathering together of the waters called he Seas and God saw 
                    <em>that</em> it was good. And God said, Let the earth bring forth grass, the herb yielding seed, and the fruit tree yielding fruit after his kind, whose seed is in itself, upon the earth and it was so. And the earth brought forth grass, and herb yielding seed after his kind, and the tree yielding fruit, whose seed was in itself, after his kind: and God saw that it was good. And the evening and the morning were the third day. And God said, Let there be lights in the firmament of the heaven to divide the day from the 
                    <em>night;</em> and let them be for signs, and for seasons, and for days, and years and let them be for lights in the firmament of the heaven to give light upon the earth and it was so. And God made two great lights; the greater light to rule the day, and the lesser light to rule the night he made the stars also. And God set them in the firmament of the heaven to give light upon the earth, and to rule over the day and over the night, and to divide the light from the darkness and God saw 
                    <em>that</em> it was good. And the evening and the morning were the fourth day. And God said, Let the waters bring forth abundantly the moving creature that hath life, and fowl that may fly above the earth in the open firmament of heaven. And God created great whales, and every living creature that moveth, which the waters brought forth abundantly, after their kind, and every winged fowl after his kind: and God saw that it was good. And God blessed them, saying, Be fruitful, and multiply, and fill the waters in the seas, and let fowl multiply in the earth. 
                    <em>And</em> the evening and the morning were the fifth day. And God said, Let the earth bring forth the living creature after his kind, cattle, and creeping thing, and beast of the earth after his kind: and it was so. And God made the beast of the earth after his kind, and cattle after their kind, and every thing that creepeth upon the earth after his kind: and God saw that it was good. And God said, Let us make man in our image, after our likeness: and let them have dominion over the fish of the sea, and over 
                    <em>the</em> fowl of the air, and over the cattle, and over all the earth, and over every creeping thing that creepeth upon the earth. So God created man in his own image, in the image of God created he him; male and female created he them. And God blessed them, and God said unto them, Be fruitful, and multiply, and replenish the earth, and subdue it: and have dominion over the fish of the sea, and over the fowl of the air, and over every living thing that moveth upon the earth. And God said, Behold, I have given you 
                    <em>every</em> herb bearing seed, which is upon the face of all the earth, and every tree, in the which is the fruit of a tree yielding seed; to you it shall be for meat. And to every beast of the earth, and to every fowl of the air, and to every thing that creepeth upon the earth, wherein there is life, I have given every green herb for meat: and it was so. And God saw every thing that he had made, and, behold, it was very good. And the evening and the morning were the sixth day. Thus the 
                    <em>heavens</em> and the earth were finished, and all the host of them. And on the seventh day God ended his work which he had made; and he rested on the seventh day from all his work which he had made. And God blessed the seventh day, and sanctified it: because that in it he had rested from all his work which God created and made. These are the generations of the heavens and of the earth when they were created, in the day that the Lord God made the earth and the heavens, and every plant of the field before 
                    <em>it</em> was in the earth, and every herb of the field before it grew: for the Lord God had not caused it to rain upon the earth, and there was not a man to till the ground. But there went up a mist from the earth, and watered the whole face of the ground. And the Lord God formed man of the dust of the ground, and breathed into his nostrils the breath of life; and man became a living soul. And the Lord God planted a garden eastward in Eden; and there he put the man whom he had 
                    <em>formed.</em>

                <p class="writing">Every Who Down in Whoville Liked Christmas a lot... But the Grinch, Who lived just north of Whoville, Did NOT! The Grinch hated Christmas! The whole Christmas season! Now, please don’t ask why. No one quite knows the reason. It could be his head wasn’t screwed on just right. It could be, perhaps, that his shoes were too tight. But I think that the most likely reason of all, May have been that his heart was two sizes too small. Whatever the reason, His heart or his shoes, He stood there on Christmas Eve, hating the Whos, Staring down
                    <em>from</em> his cave with a sour, Grinchy frown, At the warm lighted windows below in their town. For he knew every Who down in Whoville beneath, Was busy now, hanging a mistletoe wreath. “And they’re hanging their stockings!” he snarled with a sneer, “Tomorrow is Christmas! It’s practically here!” Then he growled, with his Grinch fingers nervously drumming, “I MUST find some way to stop Christmas from coming!” For Tomorrow, he knew, all the Who girls and boys, Would wake bright and early. They’d rush for their toys! And then! Oh, the noise! Oh, the Noise! Noise! Noise! Noise! That’s
                    <em>one</em> thing he hated! The NOISE! NOISE! NOISE! NOISE! Then the Whos, young and old, would sit down to a feast. And they’d feast! And they’d feast! And they’d FEAST! FEAST! FEAST! FEAST! They would feast on Who pudding, and rare Who roast beast. Which was something the Grinch couldn’t stand in the least! And THEN They’d do something He liked least of all! Every Who down in Whoville, the tall and the small, Would stand close together, with Christmas bells ringing. They’d stand hand in hand. And the Whos would start singing! They’d sing! And they’d sing! And they’d 
                    <em>SING!</em> SING! SING! SING! And the more the Grinch thought of this Who Christmas Sing, The more the Grinch thought, “I must stop this whole thing!” “Why, for fifty three years I’ve put up with it now!” “I MUST stop this Christmas from coming! But HOW?” Then he got an idea! An awful idea! THE GRINCH GOT A WONDERFUL, AWFUL IDEA! “I know just what to do!” The Grinch laughed in his throat. And he made a quick Santy Claus hat and a coat. And he chuckled, and clucked, “What a great Grinchy trick!” “With this coat and this hat,
                    <em>I</em> look just like Saint Nick!” “All I need is a reindeer...” The Grinch looked around. But, since reindeer are scarce, there was none to be found. Did that stop the old Grinch? No! The Grinch simply said, “If I can’t find a reindeer, I’ll make one instead!” So he called his dog, Max. Then he took some red thread, And he tied a big horn on the top of his head. THEN He loaded some bags And some old empty sacks, On a ramshackle sleigh And he hitched up old Max. Then the Grinch said, “Giddap!” And the sleigh
                    <em>started</em> down, Toward the homes where the Whos Lay a snooze in their town. All their windows were dark. Quiet snow filled the air. All the Whos were all dreaming sweet dreams without care. When he came to the first little house on the square. “This is stop number one,” the old Grinchy Claus hissed, And he climbed to the roof, empty bags in his fist. Then he slid down the chimney. A rather tight pinch. But, if Santa could do it, then so could the Grinch. He got stuck only once, for a moment or two. Then he stuck
                    <em>his</em> head out of the fireplace flue. Where the little Who stockings all hung in a row. “These stockings,” he grinned, “are the first things to go!” Then he slithered and slunk, with a smile most unpleasant, Around the whole room, and he took every present! Pop guns! And bicycles! Roller skates! Drums! Checkerboards! Tricycles! Popcorn! And plums! And he stuffed them in bags. Then the Grinch, very nimbly, Stuffed all the bags, one by one, up the chimney! Then he slunk to the icebox. He took the Whos’ feast! He took the Who pudding! He took the roast beast!
                    <em>He</em> cleaned out that icebox as quick as a flash. Why, that Grinch even took their last can of Who hash! Then he stuffed all the food up the chimney with glee. “And NOW!” grinned the Grinch, “I will stuff up the tree!” And the Grinch grabbed the tree, and he started to shove, When he heard a small sound like the coo of a dove. He turned around fast, and he saw a small Who! Little Cindy Lou Who, who was not more than two. The Grinch had been caught by this tiny Who daughter, Who’d got out of
                    <em>bed</em> for a cup of cold water. She stared at the Grinch and said, “Santy Claus, why,” “Why are you taking our Christmas tree? WHY?” But, you know, that old Grinch was so smart and so slick, He thought up a lie, and he thought it up quick! “Why, my sweet little tot,” the fake Santy Claus lied, “There’s a light on this tree that won’t light on one side.” “So I’m taking it home to my workshop, my dear.” “I’ll fix it up there. Then I’ll bring it back here.” And his fib fooled the child. Then he patted 
                    <em>her</em> head, And he got her a drink and he sent her to bed. And when CindyLou Who went to bed with her cup, HE went to the chimney and stuffed the tree up! Then the last thing he took Was the log for their fire! Then he went up the chimney, himself, the old liar. On their walls he left nothing but hooks and some wire. And the one speck of food That he left in the house, Was a crumb that was even too small for a mouse. Then He did the same thing To the other Whos’ 
                    <em>houses.</em>

                <p class="writing">
                    Call me Ishmael. Some years ago never mind how long precisely having little or no money in my purse, and nothing particular to interest me on shore, I thought I would sail about a little and see the watery part of the world. It is a way I have of driving off the spleen and regulating the circulation. Whenever I find myself growing grim about the mouth; whenever it is a damp, drizzly November in my soul; whenever I find myself involuntarily pausing before coffin warehouses, and bringing up the rear of every funeral I meet; and especially whenever 
                    <em>my</em> hypos get such an upper hand of me, that it requires a strong moral principle to prevent me from deliberately stepping into the street, and methodically knocking people’s hats off then, I account it high time to get to sea as soon as I can. This is my substitute for pistol and ball. With a philosophical flourish Cato throws himself upon his sword; I quietly take to the ship. There is nothing surprising in this. If they but knew it, almost all men in their degree, some time or other, cherish very nearly the same feelings towards the ocean 
                    <em>with</em> me. There now is your insular city of the Manhattoes, belted round by wharves as Indian isles by coral reefs commerce surrounds it with her surf. Right and left, the streets take you waterward. Its extreme downtown is the battery, where that noble mole is washed by waves, and cooled by breezes, which a few hours previous were out of sight of land. Look at the crowds of water gazers there. Circumambulate the city of a dreamy Sabbath afternoon. Go from Corlears Hook to Coenties Slip, and from thence, by Whitehall, northward. What do you see? Posted like silent  
                    <em>sentinels</em> all around the town, stand thousands upon thousands of mortal men fixed in ocean reveries. Some leaning against the spiles; some seated upon the pier heads; some looking over the bulwarks of ships from China; some high aloft in the rigging, as if striving to get a still better seaward peep. But these are all landsmen; of week days pent up in lath and plaster tied to counters, nailed to benches, clinched to desks. How then is this? Are the green fields gone? What do they here? But look! here come more crowds, pacing straight for the water, and 
                    <em>seemingly</em> bound for a dive. Strange! Nothing will content them but the extremest limit of the land; loitering under the shady lee of yonder warehouses will not suffice. No. They must get just as nigh the water as they possibly can without falling in. And there they stand miles of them leagues. Inlanders all, they come from lanes and alleys, streets and avenues north, east, south, and west. Yet here they all unite. Tell me, does the magnetic virtue of the needles of the compasses of all those ships attract them thither? Once more. Say you are in the country; 
                    <em>in</em> some high land of lakes. Take almost any path you please, and ten to one it carries you down in a dale, and leaves you there by a pool in the stream. There is magic in it. Let the most absent minded of men be plunged in his deepest reveries stand that man on his legs, set his feet a going, and he will infallibly lead you to water, if water there be in all that region. Should you ever be athirst in the great American desert, try this experiment, if your caravan happen to be supplied with a 
                    <em>metaphysical</em> professor. Yes, as everyone knows, meditation and water are wedded forever. But here is an artist. He desires to paint you the dreamiest, shadiest, quietest, most enchanting bit of romantic landscape in all the valley of the Saco. What is the chief element he employs? There stand his trees, each with a hollow trunk, as if a hermit and a crucifix were within; and here sleeps his meadow, and there sleep his cattle; and up from yonder cottage goes a sleepy smoke. Deep into distant woodlands winds a mazy way, reaching to overlapping spurs of mountains bathed in their 
                    <em>hill</em> side blue. But though the picture lies thus tranced, and though this pine tree shakes down its sighs like leaves upon this shepherd’s head, yet all were vain, unless the shepherd’s eye were fixed upon the magic stream before him. Go visit the Prairies in June, when for scores on scores of miles you wade knee deep among Tiger lilies what is the one charm wanting? Water there is not a drop of water there! Were Niagara but a cataract of sand, would you travel your thousand miles to see it? Why did the poor poet of Tennessee, upon 
                    <em>suddenly</em> receiving two handfuls of silver, deliberate whether to buy him a coat, which he sadly needed, or invest his money in a pedestrian trip to Rockaway Beach? Why is almost every robust healthy boy with a robust healthy soul in him, at some time or other crazy to go to sea? Why upon your first voyage as a passenger, did you yourself feel such a mystical vibration, when first told that you and your ship were now out of sight of land? Why did the old Persians hold the sea holy? Why did the Greeks give it a separate 
                    <em>deity,</em> and own brother of Jove? Surely all this is not without meaning. And still deeper the meaning of that story of Narcissus, who because he could not grasp the tormenting, mild image he saw in the fountain, plunged into it and was drowned. But that same image, we ourselves see in all rivers and oceans. It is the image of the ungraspable phantom of life; and this is the key to it all. Now, when I say that I am in the habit of going to sea whenever I begin to grow hazy about the eyes, and begin to
                    <em>be...</em>

                <p class="writing medium">
                    Once upon a midnight dreary, while I pondered, weak and weary, Over many a quaint and curious volume of forgotten lore While I nodded, nearly napping, suddenly there came a tapping, As of some one gently rapping, rapping at my chamber door. “‘Tis some visitor,” I muttered, “tapping at my chamber door Only this and nothing more.” Ah, distinctly I remember it was in the bleak December; And each separate dying ember wrought its ghost upon the floor. Eagerly I wished the morrow; vainly I had sought to borrow From my books surcease of sorrow sorrow for the lost 
                    <em>Lenore</em> For the rare and radiant maiden whom the angels name Lenore Nameless here for evermore. And the silken, sad, uncertain rustling of each purple curtain Thrilled me filled me with fantastic terrors never felt before; So that now, to still the beating of my heart, I stood repeating “‘Tis some visitor entreating entrance at my chamber door Some late visitor entreating entrance at my chamber door; This it is and nothing more.” Presently my soul grew stronger; hesitating then no longer, “Sir,” said I, “or Madam, truly your forgiveness I implore; But the fact is I was napping, and 
                    <em>so</em> gently you came rapping, And so faintly you came tapping, tapping at my chamber door, That I scarce was sure I heard you” here I opened wide the door; Darkness there and nothing more. Deep into that darkness peering, long I stood there wondering, fearing, Doubting, dreaming dreams no mortal ever dared to dream before; But the silence was unbroken, and the stillness gave no token, And the only word there spoken was the whispered word, “Lenore?” This I whispered, and an echo murmured back the word, “Lenore!” Merely this and nothing more. Back into the chamber turning, all 
                    <em>my</em> soul within me burning, Soon again I heard a tapping somewhat louder than before. “Surely,” said I, “surely that is something at my window lattice; Let me see, then, what thereat is, and this mystery explore Let my heart be still a moment and this mystery explore; ‘Tis the wind and nothing more!” Open here I flung the shutter, when, with many a flirt and flutter, In there stepped a stately Raven of the saintly days of yore; Not the least obeisance made he; not a minute stopped or stayed he; But, with mien of lord or lady, perched 
                    <em>above</em> my chamber door Perched upon a bust of Pallas just above my chamber door Perched, and sat, and nothing more. Then this ebony bird beguiling my sad fancy into smiling, By the grave and stern decorum of the countenance it wore, “Though thy crest be shorn and shaven, thou,” I said, “art sure no craven, Ghastly grim and ancient Raven wandering from the Nightly shore Tell me what thy lordly name is on the Night’s Plutonian shore!” Quoth the Raven “Nevermore.” Much I marvelled this ungainly fowl to hear discourse so plainly, Though its answer little meaning little relevancy 
                    <em>bore;</em> For we cannot help agreeing that no living human being Ever yet was blessed with seeing bird above his chamber door Bird or beast upon the sculptured bust above his chamber door, With such name as “Nevermore.” But the Raven, sitting lonely on the placid bust, spoke only That one word, as if his soul in that one word he did outpour. Nothing farther then he uttered not a feather then he fluttered Till I scarcely more than muttered “Other friends have flown before On the morrow he will leave me, as my Hopes have flown before.” Then the 
                    <em>bird</em> said “Nevermore.” Startled at the stillness broken by reply so aptly spoken, “Doubtless,” said I, “what it utters is its only stock and store Caught from some unhappy master whom unmerciful Disaster Followed fast and followed faster till his songs one burden bore Till the dirges of his Hope that melancholy burden bore Of ‘Never nevermore’.” But the Raven still beguiling all my fancy into smiling, Straight I wheeled a cushioned seat in front of bird, and bust and door; Then, upon the velvet sinking, I betook myself to linking Fancy unto fancy, thinking what this ominous bird of 
                    <em>yore</em> What this grim, ungainly, ghastly, gaunt, and ominous bird of yore Meant in croaking “Nevermore.” This I sat engaged in guessing, but no syllable expressing To the fowl whose fiery eyes now burned into my bosom’s core; This and more I sat divining, with my head at ease reclining On the cushion’s velvet lining that the lamp-light gloated o’er, But whose velvet-violet lining with the lamp-light gloating o’er, She shall press, ah, nevermore! Then, methought, the air grew denser, perfumed from an unseen censer Swung by Seraphim whose foot-falls tinkled on the tufted floor. “Wretch,” I cried, “thy God 
                    <em>hath</em> lent thee by these angels he hath sent thee Respite respite and nepenthe from thy memories of Lenore; Quaff, oh quaff this kind nepenthe and forget this lost Lenore!” Quoth the Raven “Nevermore.” “Prophet!” said I, “thing of evil! prophet still, if bird or devil! Whether Tempter sent, or whether tempest tossed thee here ashore, Desolate yet all undaunted, on this desert land enchanted On this home by Horror haunted tell me truly, I implore Is there is there balm in Gilead? tell me tell me, I implore!” Quoth the Raven “Nevermore.” “Prophet!” said I, “thing of evil! prophet 
                    <em>still,</em> if bird or devil! By that Heaven that bends above us by that God we both adore Tell this soul with sorrow laden if, within the distant Aidenn, It shall clasp a sainted maiden whom the angels name Lenore Clasp a rare and radiant maiden whom the angels name Lenore.” Quoth the Raven “Nevermore.” “Be that word our sign of parting, bird or fiend!” I shrieked, upstarting “Get thee back into the tempest and the Night’s Plutonian shore! Leave no black plume as a token of that lie thy soul hath spoken! Leave my loneliness unbroken! quit the bust

                <p class="writing medium">
                    It was a bright cold day in April, and the clocks were striking thirteen. Winston Smith, his chin nuzzled into his breast in an effort to escape the vile wind, slipped quickly through the glass doors of Victory Mansions, though not quickly enough to prevent a swirl of gritty dust from entering along with him. The hallway smelt of boiled cabbage and old rag mats. At one end of it a coloured poster, too large for indoor display, had been tacked to the wall. It depicted simply an enormous face, more than a metre wide: the face of a 
                    <em>man</em> of about forty-five, with a heavy black moustache and ruggedly handsome features. Winston made for the stairs. It was no use trying the lift. Even at the best of times it was seldom working, and at present the electric current was cut off during daylight hours. It was part of the economy drive in preparation for Hate Week. The flat was seven flights up, and Winston, who was thirty-nine and had a varicose ulcer above his right ankle, went slowly, resting several times on the way. On each landing, opposite the lift-shaft, the poster with the enormous face gazed 
                    <em>from</em> the wall. It was one of those pictures which are so contrived that the eyes follow you about when you move. BIG BROTHER IS WATCHING YOU, the caption beneath it ran. Inside the flat a fruity voice was reading out a list of figures which had something to do with the production of pig-iron. The voice came from an oblong metal plaque like a dulled mirror which formed part of the surface of the right-hand wall. Winston turned a switch and the voice sank somewhat, though the words were still distinguishable. The instrument (the telescreen, it was called) could 
                    <em>be</em> dimmed, but there was no way of shutting it off completely. He moved over to the window: a smallish, frail figure, the meagreness of his body merely emphasized by the blue overalls which were the uniform of the party. His hair was very fair, his face naturally sanguine, his skin roughened by coarse soap and blunt razor blades and the cold of the winter that had just ended. Outside, even through the shut window-pane, the world looked cold. Down in the street little eddies of wind were whirling dust and torn paper into spirals, and though the sun was 
                    <em>shining</em> and the sky a harsh blue, there seemed to be no colour in anything, except the posters that were plastered everywhere. The blackmoustachio'd face gazed down from every commanding corner. There was one on the house-front immediately opposite. BIG BROTHER IS WATCHING YOU, the caption said, while the dark eyes looked deep into Winston's own. Down at streetlevel another poster, torn at one corner, flapped fitfully in the wind, alternately covering and uncovering the single word INGSOC. In the far distance a helicopter skimmed down between the roofs, hovered for an instant like a bluebottle, and darted away again 
                    <em>with</em> a curving flight. It was the police patrol, snooping into people's windows. The patrols did not matter, however. Only the Thought Police mattered. Behind Winston's back the voice from the telescreen was still babbling away about pig-iron and the overfulfilment of the Ninth Three-Year Plan. The telescreen received and transmitted simultaneously. Any sound that Winston made, above the level of a very low whisper, would be picked up by it, moreover, so long as he remained within the field of vision which the metal plaque commanded, he could be seen as well as heard. There was of course no 
                    <em>way</em> of knowing whether you were being watched at any given moment. How often, or on what system, the Thought Police plugged in on any individual wire was guesswork. It was even conceivable that they watched everybody all the time. But at any rate they could plug in your wire whenever they wanted to. You had to live -- did live, from habit that became instinct -- in the assumption that every sound you made was overheard, and, except in darkness, every movement scrutinized. Winston kept his back turned to the telescreen. It was safer, though, as he well knew, even a 
                    <em>back</em> can be revealing. A kilometre away the Ministry of Truth, his place of work, towered vast and white above the grimy landscape. This, he thought with a sort of vague distaste -- this was London, chief city of Airstrip One, itself the third most populous of the provinces of Oceania. He tried to squeeze out some childhood memory that should tell him whether London had always been quite like this. Were there always these vistas of rotting nineteenth-century houses, their sides shored up with baulks of timber, their windows patched with cardboard and their roofs with corrugated iron, their crazy 
                    <em>garden</em> walls sagging in all directions? And the bombed sites where the plaster dust swirled in the air and the willow-herb straggled over the heaps of rubble; and the places where the bombs had cleared a larger patch and there had sprung up sordid colonies of wooden dwellings like chicken-houses? But it was no use, he could not remember: nothing remained of his childhood except a series of bright-lit tableaux occurring against no background and mostly unintelligible. The Ministry of Truth -- Minitrue, in Newspeak -- was startlingly different from any other object in sight. It was an enormous pyramidal structure of 
                    <em>glittering</em> white concrete, soaring up, terrace after terrace, 300 metres into the air. From where Winston stood it was just possible to read, picked out on its white face in elegant lettering, the three slogans of the Party: WAR IS PEACE FREEDOM IS SLAVERY IGNORANCE IS STRENGTH The Ministry of Truth contained, it was said, three thousand rooms above ground level, and corresponding ramifications below. Scattered about London there were just three other buildings of similar appearance and size. So completely did they dwarf the surrounding architecture that from the roof of Victory Mansions you could see all four of 
                    <em>them...</em>

                <p class="writing">
                    True! nervous very, very dreadfully nervous I had been and am; but why will you say that I am mad? The disease had sharpened my senses not destroyed not dulled them. Above all was the sense of hearing acute. I heard all things in the heaven and in the earth. I heard many things in hell. How, then, am I mad? Hearken! and observe how healthily how calmly I can tell you the whole story. It is impossible to say how first the idea entered my brain; but once conceived, it haunted me day and night. Object there was 
                    <em>none.</em> Passion there was none. I loved the old man. He had never wronged me. He had never given me insult. For his gold I had no desire. I think it was his eye! yes, it was this! He had the eye of a vulture a pale blue eye, with a film over it. Whenever it fell upon me, my blood ran cold; and so by degrees very gradually I made up my mind to take the life of the old man, and thus rid myself of the eye forever. Now this is the point. You fancy me mad. Madmen 
                    <em>know</em> nothing. But you should have seen me. You should have seen how wisely I proceeded with what caution with what foresight with what dissimulation I went to work! I was never kinder to the old man than during the whole week before I killed him. And every night, about midnight, I turned the latch of his door and opened it oh so gently! And then, when I had made an opening sufficient for my head, I put in a dark lantern, all closed, closed, that no light shone out, and then I thrust in my head. Oh, you would 
                    <em>have</em> laughed to see how cunningly I thrust it in! I moved it slowly very, very slowly, so that I might not disturb the old man’s sleep. It took me an hour to place my whole head within the opening so far that I could see him as he lay upon his bed. Ha! would a madman have been so wise as this, And then, when my head was well in the room, I undid the lantern cautiously-oh, so cautiously cautiously (for the hinges creaked) I undid it just so much that a single thin ray fell upon the vulture 
                    <em>eye.</em> And this I did for seven long nights every night just at midnight but I found the eye always closed; and so it was impossible to do the work; for it was not the old man who vexed me, but his Evil Eye. And every morning, when the day broke, I went boldly into the chamber, and spoke courageously to him, calling him by name in a hearty tone, and inquiring how he has passed the night. So you see he would have been a very profound old man, indeed, to suspect that every night, just at twelve, I 
                    <em>looked</em> in upon him while he slept. Upon the eighth night I was more than usually cautious in opening the door. A watch’s minute hand moves more quickly than did mine. Never before that night had I felt the extent of my own powers of my sagacity. I could scarcely contain my feelings of triumph. To think that there I was, opening the door, little by little, and he not even to dream of my secret deeds or thoughts. I fairly chuckled at the idea; and perhaps he heard me; for he moved on the bed suddenly, as if startled. 
                    <em>Now</em> you may think that I drew back but no. His room was as black as pitch with the thick darkness, (for the shutters were close fastened, through fear of robbers,) and so I knew that he could not see the opening of the door, and I kept pushing it on steadily, steadily. I had my head in, and was about to open the lantern, when my thumb slipped upon the tin fastening, and the old man sprang up in bed, crying out “Who’s there?” I kept quite still and said nothing. For a whole hour I did not move 
                    <em>a</em> muscle, and in the meantime I did not hear him lie down. He was still sitting up in the bed listening; just as I have done, night after night, hearkening to the death watches in the wall. Presently I heard a slight groan, and I knew it was the groan of mortal terror. It was not a groan of pain or of grief oh, no! it was the low stifled sound that arises from the bottom of the soul when overcharged with awe. I knew the sound well. Many a night, just at midnight, when all the world slept, 
                    <em>it</em> has welled up from my own bosom, deepening, with its dreadful echo, the terrors that distracted me. I say I knew it well. I knew what the old man felt, and pitied him, although I chuckled at heart. I knew that he had been lying awake ever since the first slight noise, when he had turned in the bed. His fears had been ever since growing upon him. He had been trying to fancy them causeless, but could not. He had been saying to himself “It is nothing but the wind in the chimney it is only a mouse 
                    <em>crossing</em> the floor,” or “It is merely a cricket which has made a single chirp.” Yes, he had been trying to comfort himself with these suppositions: but he had found all in vain. All in vain; because Death, in approaching him had stalked with his black shadow before him, and enveloped the victim. And it was the mournful influence of the unperceived shadow that caused him to feel although he neither saw nor heard to feel the presence of my head within the room. When I had waited a long time, very patiently, without hearing him lie down, I resolved 
                    <em>to...</em>

                    Once upon a time there was a lovely princess. But she had an enchantment upon her of a fearful sort, which could only be broken by Love’s first kiss. She was locked away in a castle guarded by a terrible fire breathing dragon. Many brave knights had attempted to free her from this dreadful prison, but none prevailed. She waited in the dragon’s keep in the highest room of the tallest tower for her true love and true love’s first kiss. Like that’s ever going to happen. Somebody once told me the world is gonna roll me I ain’t 
                    <em>the</em> sharpest tool in the shed She was lookin’ kind of dumb with her finger and her thumb In the shape of an “L” on her forehead The years start comin’ and they don’t stop comin’ Fed to the rules and hit the ground runnin’ Didn’t make sense not to live for fun Your brain gets smart but your head gets dumb So much to do so much to see So what’s wrong with takin’ the backstreets You’ll never know if you don’t go, You’ll never shine if you don’t glow Hey, now You’re an all star Get your game 
                    <em>on,</em> go play Hey, now You’re a rock star Get the show on, get paid And all that glitters is gold Only shootin’ stars break the mold It’s a cool place and they say it gets colder You’re bundled up now but wait till you get older But the meteor men beg to differ Judging by the hole in the satellite picture The ice we skate is gettin’ pretty thin The water’s getting warm so you might as well swim My world’s on fire How ‘bout yours That’s the way I like it and I’ll never get bored Hey, now, 
                    <em>you’re</em> an all star Get your game on, go play Hey, now You’re a rock star Get the show on, get paid And all that glitters is gold Only shootin’ stars break the mold Hey, now, you’re an all star Get your game on, go play Hey, now You’re a rock star Get the show on, get paid And all that glitters is gold Only shootin’ stars break the mold. Think he’s in here? All right. Lets get it! Hold on. Do you know what that thing can do to you? Yeah. He’ll groan into your bones for his brains.
                    <em>Well</em> actually that would be a giant. Now Ogres, huh, they are much worse. They’ll make a soup from your freshly peeled skin. They’ll chew your livers, squeeze the jelly from your eyes. Actually, it’s quite good on toast. Back, back beast, back! I warned you! Right. This is the part, where you run away. Yeah! And stay out. Wanted. Fairytale creatures. Right, this one is full. Take it away. Give me that. Your fine days are over. -25 pieces of silver for the witch. Next. -Come on. Sit down there! And be quiet! This cage is so small. You 
                    <em>wouldn’t</em> turn me in. I’ll never be stubborn again. I can change. Please, give me another chance. Oh, shut up! Next. What do we got? This little wooden puppet. I’m not a puppet, I’m a real boy. Five shillings for the possessed toy. Take it away. No! Please, don’t let them do it! Next. What do you got? Well, I’ve got a talking donkey! Right. Well that’s good for ten shillings, if you can prove it. Oh, go ahead fella. Well? He’s just a li..., just a little nervous. He’s really quite a chatterbox. You boneheaded donkey! That’s it. I 
                    <em>have</em> heard enough. Guards! No, no, he talks, he does! I can talk. I love to talk. I’ve talked to... Get her out of my sight! -No, no, I swear! Hey, I can fly. -He can fly! -He can fly! He can talk! -That’s right, fool! Now I’m a flying, talking donkey! You might have seen a housefly, maybe even a superfly. But I bet you ain’t never seen a donkey fly! Seize him! Get him! This way! Hurry! You there. Ogre. -I. By the order of lord Farquaad. I am authorized to place you both under arrest. And transport 
                    <em>you</em> to a designated resettlement facility. Oh really? You and what army? Can I say something to you? Listen, you were really, really something, back there. Incredible. Are you talking to... ...me? Yes, I was talking to you. Can I just tell you that you were really great back there with those guards. They thought that was all over there. And then you showed up and BAM. There was tripping over themselves like babes in the woods. That really made me feel good to see that. Oh, that’s great. Really. Man, it’s good to be free. Now, why don’t you 
                    <em>go</em> celebrate your freedom with your own friends? But I... I don’t have any friends. And I’m not going out there by myself. Hey wait a minute. I have a great idea... I’ll stick with you. You and me are a green fighting machine. Together we’ll scare the spin if anybody crosses us. Oh, a, that was really scary. Maybe you don’t mind me saying. If that doesn’t work, your breath will certainly get the job done, ‘cause... you definitely need some tic-tac or something, ‘cause your breath stinks! Man you’ve hit my note! Just like the time. and then
                    <em>I</em> ate some rotten berries. Man I had some strong gases leaking out of my butt that day. Why are you following me? I’ll tell you why. ‘Cause I’m all alone, there is no one here, beside me. My problems have all gone. There’s no one to derive me. But you got to have free ... -Stop singing! Well, it’s no wonder, you don’t have any friends. Wow! Only a true friend would be that truly honest. Listen! Little donkey. Take a look at me! What am I? A... really tall? No! I’m an Ogre. You know, grab your torch and

                <p class="writing">
                    Welcome to the dangerous and challenging world of bomb defusing. Study this manual carefully; you are the expert. In these pages you will find everything you need to know to defuse even the most insidious of bombs. And remember — One small oversight and it could all be over! Defusing Bombs A bomb will explode when its countdown timer reaches 0 or when too many strikes have been recorded. The only way to defuse a bomb is to disarm all of its modules before its countdown timer expires. Modules Each bomb will include up to 11 modules that must be
                    <em>disarmed.</em> Each module is discrete and can be disarmed in any order. Instructions for disarming modules can be found in Section 1. “Needy” modules present a special case and are described in Section 2. Strikes When the Defuser makes a mistake, the bomb will record a strike which will be displayed on the indicator above the countdown timer. Bombs with a strike indicator will explode upon the third strike. The timer will begin to count down faster after a strike has been recorded. If no strike indicator is present above the countdown timer, the bomb will explode upon the first
                    <em>strike,</em> leaving no room for error. Gathering Information Some disarming instructions will require specific information about the bomb, such as the serial number. This type of information can typically be found on the top, bottom, or sides of the bomb casing. See Appendix A, B, and C for identification instructions that will be useful in disarming certain modules. Section 1: Modules Modules can be identified by an LED in the top right corner. When this LED is lit green, the module has been disarmed. All modules must be disarmed to defuse the bomb. On the Subject of Wires Wires are
                    <em>the</em> lifeblood of electronics! Wait, no, electricity is the lifeblood. Wires are more like the arteries. The veins? No matter... A wire module can have 3-6 wires on it. Only the one correct wire needs to be cut to disarm the module. Wire ordering begins with the first on the top. 3 wires: If there are no red wires, cut the second wire. Otherwise, if the last wire is white, cut the last wire. Otherwise, if there is more than one blue wire, cut the last blue wire. Otherwise, cut the last wire. 4 wires: If there is more than
                    <em>one</em> red wire and the last digit of the serial number is odd, cut the last red wire. Otherwise, if the last wire is yellow and there are no red wires, cut the first wire. Otherwise, if there is exactly one blue wire, cut the first wire. Otherwise, if there is more than one yellow wire, cut the last wire. Otherwise, cut the second wire. 5 wires: If the last wire is black and the last digit of the serial number is odd, cut the fourth wire. Otherwise, if there is exactly one red wire and there is more than
                    <em>one</em> yellow wire, cut the first wire. Otherwise, if there are no black wires, cut the second wire. Otherwise, cut the first wire. 6 wires: If there are no yellow wires and the last digit of the serial number is odd, cut the third wire. Otherwise, if there is exactly one yellow wire and there is more than one white wire, cut the fourth wire. Otherwise, if there are no red wires, cut the last wire. Otherwise, cut the fourth wire. On the Subject of The Button You might think that a button telling you to press it is pretty
                    <em>straightforward.</em> That’s the kind of thinking that gets people exploded. See Appendix A for indicator identification reference. See Appendix B for battery identification reference. Follow these rules in the order they are listed. Perform the first action that applies: If the button is blue and the button says “Abort”, hold the button and refer to “Releasing a Held Button”. If there is more than 1 battery on the bomb and the button says “Detonate”, press and immediately release the button. If the button is white and there is a lit indicator with label CAR, hold the button and refer to
                    <em>“Releasing</em> a Held Button”. If there are more than 2 batteries on the bomb and there is a lit indicator with label FRK, press and immediately release the button. If the button is yellow, hold the button and refer to “Releasing a Held Button”. If the button is red and the button says “Hold”, press and immediately release the button. If none of the above apply, hold the button and refer to “Releasing a Held Button”. Releasing a Held Button If you start holding the button down, a colored strip will light up on the right side of the module.
                    <em>Based</em> on its color, you must release the button at a specific point in time: Blue strip: release when the countdown timer has a 4 in any position. White strip: release when the countdown timer has a 1 in any position. Yellow strip: release when the countdown timer has a 5 in any position. Any other color strip: release when the countdown timer has a 1 in any position. On the Subject of Keypads I’m not sure what these symbols are, but I suspect they have something to do with occult. Only one column below has all four of the
                    <em>symbols</em> from the keypad. Press the four buttons in the order their symbols appear from top to bottom within that column. On the Subject of Simon Says This is like one of those toys you played with as a kid where you have to match the pattern that appears, except this one is a knockoff that was probably purchased at a dollar store. One of the four colored buttons will flash. Using the correct table below, press the button with the corresponding color. The original button will flash, followed by another. Repeat this sequence in order using the color mapping.

                <p class="writing small">
                    Valve respects the privacy of its online visitors and customers of its products and services and complies with applicable laws for the protection of your privacy, including, without limitation, the California Consumer Privacy Act (“CCPA”), the European Union General Data Protection Regulation (“GDPR”) and the UK GDPR. 1. Definitions Wherever we talk about Personal Data below, we mean any information that can either itself identify you as an individual (“Personally Identifying Information”) or that can be connected to you indirectly by linking it to Personally Identifying Information. Valve also processes anonymous data, aggregated or not, to analyze and produce 
                    <em>statistics</em> related to the habits, usage patterns, and demographics of customers as a group or as individuals. Such anonymous data does not allow the identification of the customers to which it relates. Valve may share anonymous data, aggregated or not, with third parties. Other capitalized terms in this Privacy Policy shall have the meanings defined in the Steam Subscriber Agreement (“SSA”). 2. Why Valve Collects and Processes Data Valve collects and processes Personal Data for the following reasons: a) where it is necessary for the performance of our agreement with you to provide a full-featured gaming service and deliver associated 
                    <em>Content</em> and Services; b) where it is necessary for compliance with legal obligations that we are subject to (e.g. our obligations to keep certain information under tax laws); c) where it is necessary for the purposes of the legitimate and legal interests of Valve or a third party (e.g. the interests of our other customers), except where such interests are overridden by your prevailing legitimate interests and rights; or d) where you have given consent to it. These reasons for collecting and processing Personal Data determine and limit what Personal Data we collect and how we use it (section 3. 
                    <em>below),</em> how long we store it (section 4. below), who has access to it (section 5. below) and what rights and other control mechanisms are available to you as a user (section 6. below). 3. The Types and Sources of Data We Collect 3.1 Basic Account Data When setting up an Account, Valve will collect your email address and country of residence. You are also required to choose a user name and a password. The provision of this information is necessary to register a Steam User Account. During setup of your account, the account is automatically assigned a number (the 
                    <em>“Steam</em> ID”) that is later used to reference your user account without directly exposing Personally Identifying Information about you. We do not require you to provide or use your real name for the setup of a Steam User Account. 3.2 Transaction and Payment Data In order to make a transaction on Steam (e.g. to purchase Subscriptions for Content and Services or to fund your Steam Wallet), you may need to provide payment data to Valve to enable the transaction. If you pay by credit card, you need to provide typical credit card information (name, address, credit card number, expiration date <em>and</em> security code) to Valve, which Valve will process and transmit to the payment service provider of your choice to enable the transaction and perform anti-fraud checks. Likewise, Valve will receive data from your payment service provider for the same reasons. 3.3 Other Data You Explicitly Submit We will collect and process Personal Data whenever you explicitly provide it to us or send it as part of communication with others on Steam, e.g. in Steam Community Forums, chats, or when you provide feedback or other user generated content. This data includes: Information that you post, comment or follow in any 
                    <em>of</em> our Content and Services; Information sent through chat; Information you provide when you request information or support from us or purchase Content and Services from us, including information necessary to process your orders with the relevant payment merchant or, in case of physical goods, shipping providers; Information you provide to us when participating in competitions, contests and tournaments or responding to surveys, e.g. your contact details. 3.4 Your Use of the Steam Client and Websites We collect a variety of information through your general interaction with the websites, Content and Services offered by Steam. Personal Data we collect may 
                    <em>include,</em> but is not limited to, browser and device information, data collected through automated electronic interactions and application usage data. Likewise, we will track your process across our websites and applications to verify that you are not a bot and to optimize our services. 3.5 Your Use of Games and other Subscriptions In order to provide you with services, we need to collect, store and use various information about your activity in our Content and Services. “Content-Related Information” includes your Steam ID, as well as what is usually referred to as “game statistics”. By game statistics we mean information about 
                    <em>your</em> games’ preferences, progress in the games, playtime, as well as information about the device you are using, including what operating system you are using, device settings, unique device identifiers, and crash data. 3.6 Tracking Data and Cookies We use “Cookies”, which are text files placed on your computer, and similar technologies (e.g. web beacons, pixels, ad tags and device identifiers) to help us analyze how users use our services, as well as to improve the services we are offering, to improve marketing, analytics or website functionality. The use of Cookies is standard on the internet. Although most web browsers 
                    <em>automatically</em> accept cookies, the decision of whether to accept or not is yours.

                <p class="writing medium">
                    The unanimous Declaration of the thirteen united States of America, When in the Course of human events, it becomes necessary for one people to dissolve the political bands which have connected them with another, and to assume among the powers of the earth, the separate and equal station to which the Laws of Nature and of Nature’s God entitle them, a decent respect to the opinions of mankind requires that they should declare the causes which impel them to the separation. We hold these truths to be self-evident, that all men are created equal, that they are endowed by 
                    <em>their</em> Creator with certain unalienable Rights, that among these are Life, Liberty and the pursuit of Happiness. That to secure these rights, Governments are instituted among Men, deriving their just powers from the consent of the governed, That whenever any Form of Government becomes destructive of these ends, it is the Right of the People to alter or to abolish it, and to institute new Government, laying its foundation on such principles and organizing its powers in such form, as to them shall seem most likely to effect their Safety and Happiness. Prudence, indeed, will dictate that Governments long established 
                    <em>should</em> not be changed for light and transient causes; and accordingly all experience hath shewn, that mankind are more disposed to suffer, while evils are sufferable, than to right themselves by abolishing the forms to which they are accustomed. But when a long train of abuses and usurpations, pursuing invariably the same Object evinces a design to reduce them under absolute Despotism, it is their right, it is their duty, to throw off such Government, and to provide new Guards for their future security. Such has been the patient sufferance of these Colonies; and such is now the necessity which 
                    <em>constrains</em> them to alter their former Systems of Government. The history of the present King of Great Britain is a history of repeated injuries and usurpations, all having in direct object the establishment of an absolute Tyranny over these States. To prove this, let Facts be submitted to a candid world. He has refused his Assent to Laws, the most wholesome and necessary for the public good. He has forbidden his Governors to pass Laws of immediate and pressing importance, unless suspended in their operation till his Assent should be obtained; and when so suspended, he has utterly neglected to 
                    <em>attend</em> to them. He has refused to pass other Laws for the accommodation of large districts of people, unless those people would relinquish the right of Representation in the Legislature, a right inestimable to them and formidable to tyrants only. He has called together legislative bodies at places unusual, uncomfortable, and distant from the depository of their public Records, for the sole purpose of fatiguing them into compliance with his measures. He has dissolved Representative Houses repeatedly, for opposing with manly firmness his invasions on the rights of the people. He has refused for a long time, after such dissolutions, 
                    <em>to</em> cause others to be elected; whereby the Legislative powers, incapable of Annihilation, have returned to the People at large for their exercise; the State remaining in the mean time exposed to all the dangers of invasion from without, and convulsions within. He has endeavoured to prevent the population of these States; for that purpose obstructing the Laws for Naturalization of Foreigners; refusing to pass others to encourage their migrations hither, and raising the conditions of new Appropriations of Lands. He has obstructed the Administration of Justice, by refusing his Assent to Laws for establishing Judiciary powers. He has made 
                    <em>Judges</em> dependent on his Will alone, for the tenure of their offices, and the amount and payment of their salaries. He has erected a multitude of New Offices, and sent hither swarms of Officers to harrass our people, and eat out their substance. He has kept among us, in times of peace, Standing Armies without the Consent of our legislatures. He has affected to render the Military independent of and superior to the Civil power. He has combined with others to subject us to a jurisdiction foreign to our constitution, and unacknowledged by our laws; giving his Assent to their 
                    <em>Acts</em> of pretended Legislation: For Quartering large bodies of armed troops among us: For protecting them, by a mock Trial, from punishment for any Murders which they should commit on the Inhabitants of these States: For cutting off our Trade with all parts of the world: For imposing Taxes on us without our Consent: For depriving us in many cases, of the benefits of Trial by Jury: For transporting us beyond Seas to be tried for pretended offences, For abolishing the free System of English Laws in a neighbouring Province, establishing therein an Arbitrary government, and enlarging its Boundaries so 
                    <em>as</em> to render it at once an example and fit instrument for introducing the same absolute rule into these Colonies: For taking away our Charters, abolishing our most valuable Laws, and altering fundamentally the Forms of our Governments: For suspending our own Legislatures, and declaring themselves invested with power to legislate for us in all cases whatsoever. He has abdicated Government here, by declaring us out of his Protection and waging War against us. He has plundered our seas, ravaged our Coasts, burnt our towns, and destroyed the lives of our people. He is at this time transporting large Armies 
                    <em>of</em> foreign Mercenaries to compleat the works of death, desolation and tyranny, already begun with circumstances of Cruelty and perfidy scarcely paralleled in the most barbarous ages, and totally unworthy the Head of a civilized nation. He has constrained our fellow Citizens taken Captive on the high Seas to bear Arms against their Country, to become the executioners of their friends and Brethren, or to fall themselves by their Hands. He has excited domestic insurrections amongst us, and has endeavoured to bring on the inhabitants of our frontiers, the merciless Indian Savages, whose known rule of warfare, is an undistinguished 
                    <em>destruction...</em>

                <p class="writing small">
                    C# (pronounced “See Sharp”) is a modern, object-oriented, and type-safe programming language. C# enables developers to build many types of secure and robust applications that run in .NET. C# has its roots in the C family of languages and will be immediately familiar to C, C++, Java, and JavaScript programmers. This tour provides an overview of the major components of the language in C# 11 and earlier. If you want to explore the language through interactive examples, try the introduction to C# tutorials. C# is an object-oriented, component-oriented programming language. C# provides language constructs to directly support these concepts, 
                    <em>making</em> C# a natural language in which to create and use software components. Since its origin, C# has added features to support new workloads and emerging software design practices. At its core, C# is an object-oriented language. You define types and their behavior. Several C# features help create robust and durable applications. Garbage collection automatically reclaims memory occupied by unreachable unused objects. Nullable types guard against variables that don’t refer to allocated objects. Exception handling provides a structured and extensible approach to error detection and recovery. Lambda expressions support functional programming techniques. Language Integrated Query (LINQ) syntax creates a common 
                    <em>pattern</em> for working with data from any source. Language support for asynchronous operations provides syntax for building distributed systems. C# has a unified type system. All C# types, including primitive types such as int and double, inherit from a single root object type. All types share a set of common operations. Values of any type can be stored, transported, and operated upon in a consistent manner. Furthermore, C# supports both user-defined reference types and value types. C# allows dynamic allocation of objects and in-line storage of lightweight structures. C# supports generic methods and types, which provide increased type safety and 
                    <em>performance.</em> C# provides iterators, which enable implementers of collection classes to define custom behaviors for client code. C# emphasizes versioning to ensure programs and libraries can evolve over time in a compatible manner. Aspects of C#’s design that were directly influenced by versioning considerations include the separate virtual and override modifiers, the rules for method overload resolution, and support for explicit interface member declarations. .NET architecture C# programs run on .NET, a virtual execution system called the common language runtime (CLR) and a set of class libraries. The CLR is the implementation by Microsoft of the common language infrastructure (CLI), 
                    <em>an</em> international standard. The CLI is the basis for creating execution and development environments in which languages and libraries work together seamlessly. Source code written in C# is compiled into an intermediate language (IL) that conforms to the CLI specification. The IL code and resources, such as bitmaps and strings, are stored in an assembly, typically with an extension of .dll. An assembly contains a manifest that provides information about the assembly’s types, version, and culture. When the C# program is executed, the assembly is loaded into the CLR. The CLR performs Just-In-Time (JIT) compilation to convert the IL code 
                    <em>to</em> native machine instructions. The CLR provides other services related to automatic garbage collection, exception handling, and resource management. Code that’s executed by the CLR is sometimes referred to as “managed code.” “Unmanaged code,” is compiled into native machine language that targets a specific platform. Language interoperability is a key feature of .NET. IL code produced by the C# compiler conforms to the Common Type Specification (CTS). IL code generated from C# can interact with code that was generated from the .NET versions of F#, Visual Basic, C++. There are more than 20 other CTS-compliant languages. A single assembly may 
                    <em>contain</em> multiple modules written in different .NET languages. The types can reference each other as if they were written in the same language. In addition to the runtime services, .NET also includes extensive libraries. These libraries support many different workloads. They’re organized into namespaces that provide a wide variety of useful functionality. The libraries include everything from file input and output to string manipulation to XML parsing, to web application frameworks to Windows Forms controls. The typical C# application uses the .NET class library extensively to handle common “plumbing” chores. For more information about .NET, see Overview of .NET. Hello 
                    <em>world</em> The “Hello, World” program is traditionally used to introduce a programming language. Here it is in C#: The “Hello, World” program starts with a using directive that references the System namespace. Namespaces provide a hierarchical means of organizing C# programs and libraries. Namespaces contain types and other namespaces—for example, the System namespace contains a number of types, such as the Console class referenced in the program, and many other namespaces, such as IO and Collections. A using directive that references a given namespace enables unqualified use of the types that are members of that namespace. The Hello class declared
                    <em>by</em> the “Hello, World” program has a single member, the method named Main. The Main method is declared with the static modifier. While instance methods can reference a particular enclosing object instance using the keyword this, static methods operate without reference to a particular object. By convention, a static method named Main serves as the entry point of a C# program. The output of the program is produced by the WriteLine method of the Console class in the System namespace. This class is provided by the standard class libraries, which, by default, are automatically referenced by the compiler. You use 
                    <em>the</em> .NET SDK to build your own “Hello, World” program. Once you install the SDK, you run dotnet new console to create a basic “Hello, World” program that you can modify. For more information, see the Hello, World tutorial in the .NET Get started section. Types and variables A type defines the structure and behavior of any data in C#. The declaration of a type may include its members, base type, interfaces it implements, and operations permitted for that type. A variable is a label that refers to an instance of a specific type. There are two kinds of types

                <p class="writing">
                    First of all, I want to get something straight: this is a JOURNAL, not a diary. I know what it says on the cover but when Mom went out to buy this thing I SPECIFICALLY said to make sure it didn’t say "diary" on it. So don’t expect me to be all "dear diary this" and "dear diary that". All I need is for some jerk to catch me carrying this thing around and get the wrong idea. The other thing I want to clear up right away is how this was NOT my idea, it was Mom’s. The 
                    <em>deal</em> is that if I write in this book a little bit each day I get out of one chore on Saturdays, so of course I picked the one I hate the most. But if Rodrick ever finds out he’s scrubbing toilets because of this book, I’m dead. Oh yeah Rodrick’s my brother. I try to avoid him anyway but now that I struck this deal with Mom, I better be extra careful. Anyway I think Mom has this idea I’m going to write down my "feelings" and all that, but she’s not actually allowed to read it so I 
                    <em>figure</em> I’ll just write what I want. The real reason I agreed to do this at all is because I figure later on when I’m rich and famous I’ll have better things to do than answer people’s stupid questions all day long. Like I said, one day I will definitely be famous, but for now I’m stuck in the seventh grade with a bunch of morons. Today is the first day of school and right now we’re just waiting around for the teacher to hurry up and finish the seating chart. So I figured I might as well write in 
                    <em>this</em> book and just get it over with for the day. But I’ll tell you something... on the first day of school, you got to be real careful of where you sit. You walk into the classroom and just plunk your stuff down on any old desk and the next thing you know the teacher is saying "I hope you all like where you’re sitting because these are your permanent seats". So in this class I got stuck with Chris Hosey in front of me and Lionel James in back of me. Otha Harris came in late and almost sat 
                    <em>next</em> to me but luckily I did some quick thinking and got myself out of that one. I’m thinking for next period I should just sit in the middle of a bunch of cute girls as soon as I step in the room. Then again if I do that it just proves that I didn’t learn a thing from last year. Plus the other thing I got to think about is that girls don’t let you copy off of them, which could be a real problem in a class like Pre Algebra. Speaking of seating, something that really stunk today
                    <em>is</em> how in home room I got stuck with some teacher who had Rodrick in his class a few years back. The only good thing I can think about the first day of school is that some of the teachers are new and so you can slide a little. Anyway the teacher is almost done with the seating chart and I think I wrote enough in this book to keep Mom off my back for today. This morning Mom made me lend my brother Rodrick some of my money so he could buy lunch, which really stunk. I’m still mad 
                    <em>at</em> Rodrick for the trick he pulled on me at the beginning of the summer so I’m really not looking to do him any favors. What happened was that on the first day of summer vacation, he woke me up in the middle of the night dressed up in his school clothes. He told me I slept through the whole summer but that luckily I had woken up in time for the first day of school. You might think I’m pretty dumb for falling for that one, but I was too groggy to know any better and plus Rodrick had 
                    <em>set</em> my clock ahead and pulled the blinds shut. So I just got up and got dressed and went downstairs to fix myself some breakfast. I must’ve made a big racket because the next thing I knew Dad was in my face wondering what the heck I was doing eating Cheerios at 3 am. The thing about Dad when he comes downstairs late at night is that he’s always just wearing a tee shirt and some boxer shorts. I don’t know which is worse, getting yelled out or having to see your father in his underwear. I keep meaning to 
                    <em>ask</em> him to please put on some more clothes the next time he comes downstairs but the right opportunity never comes up. Anyway it took me a couple of minutes to figure out what all was going on. When I told Dad Rodrick tricked me Dad stomped on down to Rodrick’s room in the basement and I followed along. I was pretty excited to finally see Rodrick get what was coming to him. But when we got down there Rodrick had covered up his tracks pretty good and you would never know he had been up to something. Dad just 
                    <em>threw</em> up his hands and went back up to bed. So now Dad thought I was an idiot AND a liar. Come to think of it ever since Dad has been real suspicious around me, like I’m turning into a bad kid or something. I’ll put it to you this way... if I’m going to do something bad and take the heat like I did that night you better believe I’m going to come up with something a lot more satisfying than eating a bowl of Cheerios in the middle of the night. Today in Social Studies I scored pretty
