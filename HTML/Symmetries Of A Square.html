                <h2>On the Subject of Symmetries Of A Square</h2>
                <p class="flavour-text">Who lives in a module under the sea?</p>

                <p>A square has eight symmetries - actions that leave the shape of the square unchanged, including doing nothing.</p>
				<p>The symmetries are notated on the module as follows; an arrow outisde the square represents a rotation, and a line through the square represents a reflection.</p>

				<p>To identify the different symmetries, the corners of the square are numbered like so.</p>
				<img style='width: 50%' src="img/Symmetries Of A Square/Numbering.svg">
				<p>To solve the module, press the four corners of the square in order of their numbers after the three symmetries on the module have been applied.</p>
				<p><strong>Useful note: The composition of any number of symmetries is always one of the eight symmetries above. A set of symmetries like this is a type of mathematical object called a group. Practice the module to get a feel for the underlying structure behind it. Also be sure to check out 3blue1brown's videos on the topic, which make for interesting viewing if you want to learn more.</strong></p>
