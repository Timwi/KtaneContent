                <h2>On the Subject of Circuit Charging</h2>
                <p class="flavour-text">The company that makes these has to be doing this on purpose. Why are there so many completely broken modules?</p>

                <p>This module contains a circuit board with various components that don’t have power flowing to them. You can place down resistors, the first with high resistance and the second with low resistance, to connect them to the power source, then press the button on the top left to send a charge to them and gain a clue for a five letter word you need to submit. Each combination of high and low resistance corresponds to a different type of hint. Each green rectangle on the module corresponds to a spot where you can place a resistor to power the corresponding component from left to right.</p>
				<p>To begin, connect just the speaker to the power source using either resistor and send a charge to it. This will cause it to read out two pairs of forbidden combinations, with the first component of each pair being the one with high resistance and the second being the one with low resistance. Attempting to send a charge to these forbidden pairs will cause a strike.</p>
				<p>Inputting the wrong word will result in a strike. There is only one correct solution based on the clues given. The list of accepted words is below.</p>

                <p>Both components will read out two morse characters at the same time. These two characters will be present in the word and next to each other in either order.</p>
				<h3>Light, Letter Display</h3>
                <p>The letter display will show a letter and the light will flash a certain amount of times. The number of times the light flashes is equal to the position that letter is in in the word.</p>
				<h3>Speaker, Light</h3>
                <p>The speaker will read out five letters while the light flashes a few times. Caesar shift the five letters forward by the number of times the light flashed. Two of the letters you get will be in the corresponding position in the word.</p>
				<h3>Speaker, Letter Display</h3>
                <p>The speaker will beep a series of high and low tones while the letter display has some segments lit up. Each beep corresponds to a segment in reading order. Toggle each segment with a high beep corresponding to it to get a letter. This will be the last letter of the word.</p>
				<h3>Letter Display, Light</h3>
                <p>The letter display will show a letter while the light flashes six times. Each flash corresponds to a braille dot in braille reading order (top to bottom then left to right). Take the braille representation of the letter shown on the letter display, invert all of the dots that correspond to a long flash, then convert the result back into a letter. That is the first letter of the word.</p>
				<h3>Letter Display, Speaker</h3>
                <p>Multiple segments on the letter display will flash one at a time while the speaker reads out two numbers. Combine the segments that flashed together to get a letter. The two numbers that were read out are the possible positions it can be in.</p>
