                <h2>On the Subject of Faulty RGB Mazes</h2>
                <p class="flavour-text">Now you too can experience... wait, where am I?</p>
                <div style="font-size: 9.75pt;">
                    <p>This module consists of a 7×7 grid of LEDs and a crooked seven segment display.</p>
                    <p>On this 7×7 grid are three mazes:<br>one with red walls, one with green, and one with blue.<br>
                    Each of these mazes contains a key. All three of these keys are initially shown on the grid.</p>
                    <p>The keys will flicker, giving a sequence of four bits each.<br>For each of the four bits:
                        <ul><li>If the key is visible, the bit is a 1.</li>
                            <li>If the key is not visible, the bit is a 0.</li></ul>
                        The keys will be visible for a full second between repeats of the sequence.</p>
                    <p>The seven segment display shows three numbers that correspond to each of the mazes, which also overlap and mix additively.</p>
                    <p>Pressing any of the LEDs will reveal the starting location, a white LED, somewhere within the red maze. The keys are then hidden but will not be moved from their original locations.</p>
                    <p>Press an adjacent grey LED to move. Avoid hitting the walls of the mazes.
                    <p>Press the white LED to switch between mazes:
                    <ul><li>The white LEDs in each maze are offset from each other by a fixed number of spaces in each direction.</li>
                        <li>Each maze has a set of defective LEDs that are identified by the sequence of bits obtained from its corresponding key.<br>
                            Mazes cannot be switched if the white LED is defective.</li></ul>
                    <p>Once all three keys are collected, the seven segment display will change.<br>
                    Each of the three colour components give a coordinate of the location of the exit:
                    <ul><li>One of the components is a number. This gives the row the exit lies in.</li>
                        <li>One of the other components is a letter. This gives the column the exit lies in.</li>
                        <li>The remaining component is a random pattern that is neither a number or a letter.<br> The exit lies in the maze that is the same colour as this component.</li></ul>
                    Note: Columns B and D are shown in lowercase to disambiguate them from 8 and 0; the rest of the columns are uppercase letters.<br>Hexadecimal numbers a–f, however, are always lowercase.</p>

                <div style="font-size: 9.75pt;">
                    <p>Each colour component of the seven segment display is a hexadecimal number corresponding to one of the mazes below.</p>
                    <p>Each component may be shown normally or inverted; segments that would normally be on are off and vice versa.</p>
                    <p>Each of the mazes has an LED at one of its corners that is the same colour as the maze itself, identifying the orientation of that maze.<br>
                    The mazes may have been flipped horizontally and/or vertically such that the LEDs are flipped onto the appropriate corners of the grid.<br>
                    The colours of the LEDs mix additively if their respective mazes have the same orientation.</p>
                    <p>Each of the mazes below have their LEDs at the top left corner of the grid.</p>
