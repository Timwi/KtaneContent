                <p class="flavour-text">By the end of this, you’ll be able to put this language on your resume.
                    Put it next to a bunch of Pokemon names and the recruiters will think you’re some coding master.
                    Then, all you’ll have to do is learn how to code.
                </p>

                <p>
                    On this module you will find a speaker, a play button, a submit button, a screen, and a keypad with numbers 0 through 9.
                    Upon pressing the play button, some lines of code of the esoteric programming language “Drive-In Window” will be spoken aloud to the defuser.
                    Once finished, input an answer based on the value of the first customer at the end of the code using the keypad below, clicking the green button to submit.
                    On inputting an incorrect answer, you will receive a strike and all inputs will be reset.
                    You can press the play button to replay the code at any time the speaker is not playing, and can press the screen to clear any input.
                    Refer to appendix <b>FR1ES</b> to help interpret the code.
                    More information about the language can be found <a href="https://esolangs.org/wiki/Drive-In_Window">here</a>.
                </p>
                    <h4>Note:</h4>
                <p>
                    If the serial number contains two 9s and there is a lit CAR indicator, your order is Big Smoke’s order. The answer is 999674545.
