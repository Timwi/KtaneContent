                        <ul>
                            <li>The module shows a stage counter, a colour indicator and ten flashing lights with corresponding buttons underneath.</li>
                            <li>On solving each module*, a 3-5 note sequence will flash, a colour will be displayed on the indicator and the stage counter will increase by one.</li>
                            <li>The lights will flash in one of ten colours (see the below table). A corresponding letter will confirm the colour for the flashed light and another for the colour indicator for that stage.</li>
                            <li><span class='bold'>Take note of the sequence and the colour of the indicator. Do not press any buttons during this instance as that will result in a strike.</span></li>
                            <li>When <cite>Simon’s Stages</cite> is one of the last solvable modules, the solve counter will go blank and the indicator will emit a steady blink. At this point, <span class='bold'>the module is now ready to be solved.</span></li>
                            <li>Input the correct sequence for each stage (from 01 to the last available stage) in accordance with the rules in the table below. The final press of a stage will be signified by a stronger interaction punch upon pressing the button.</li>

                           The example provided uses the table above. You may not get this combination upon encountering Simon's Stages.

                            Colours opposite of the sequence refers in respect to the upper and lower halves of the given colours in the same given position on each half.
                        </p>
                        <p>
                            From the example provided, red is opposite to green, blue is opposite to pink, yellow is opposite to lime, orange is opposite to cyan, and magenta is opposite to white.
                        </p>
                        <p>
                            So if the color of the flashing sequence is white, orange, pink, and you needed to input colors opposite in the sequence, you would input magenta, cyan, blue for this condition because magenta is opposite to white, cyan is opposite to orange, and blue is opposite to pink.
