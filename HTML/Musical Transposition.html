                    <h3>1. Start with the last digit in the serial number, then follow the steps below.</h3>

                    <ul>
                        <li>If there is a vowel in the serial number, add 3.</li>
                        
                        <li>Subtract the amount of battery holders on the bomb.</li>
                        
                        <li>If there is 2 or more lit indicators, add 2.
                        	<ul>
                        		<li>Skip this step is there is a lit FRK label present.</li>
                        	</ul>
                        </li>
                        
                        <li>If there is 2 or more unlit indicators, subtract 2.
                        	<ul>
                        		<li>Skip this step is there is an unlit CAR label present.</li>
                        	</ul>
                        </li>
                        <li>If there is at least one Stereo RCA port on the bomb, subtract 4.</li>
                        
                        <li>Finally, if there is a serial port on the bomb, double this number.*</li>
                    </ul>
                    <p>*Note - If the number is negative, keep adding 5 until it becomes positive.</p>

                    <h3>2. Using that number, follow the table below to find a transposition number.</h3>
                    <h3>3. On the screen on the left, one or two letters will come up. Refer to Musical Transposition : Appendix A for definitions. Transpose the set of notes given on the top screen using these.</h3>
                    <h3>4. Now, transpose the new notes up or down (or none) by the amount of semitones given by the table.</h3>

					<h2>Appendix A: Musical Terms</h2>
					<p>
						To clarify, the note below a C would be a B, and similarly, the note after a B would be a C. The 12 tones on the piano essentially wrap around.<br><br>
						The Prime sequence (or 'P' for short), is the original or base form of the 12-tone row. No transformation takes place.<br><br>
						The Retrograde sequence (or 'R' for short), takes the Prime sequence, but executes it in reverse order. For example, the Retrograde of the Prime row A B C D E would be E D C B A.<br><br>
						The Inverse sequence (or 'I' for short), takes the Prime sequence, but the intervals between the notes are inverted. For example, take the interval from A to B; the interval is +2 semitones, as it takes you 2 semitones to get from A to B (A goes to A# then B). The inversion of this interval would be -2 semitones. Therefore, the inverted sequence would be A then G, as G is -2 semitones away from A (A goes to G# then G).
						As an extended example, the Inversion of the Prime row A B C D E would be A G F# E D; the first note always remains the same, and all the other notes get inverted relative to that note.<br><br>
						The Retrograde Inverse sequence (or 'RI' for short), takes the Inverse sequence in Retrograde. For example, the Retrograde Inverse of the Prime row A B C D E would take the Inverse first (which is A G F# E D), and then the Retrograde of this Inverse would be D E F# G A.<br><br>
						Transpositions apply a translation of the tone row up or down by a given number of semitones. For example, the Prime row A B C D E transposed up by 1 semitone would be A# C C# D# F.<br><br>
						An Interval is the tonal distance between two distinct notes and is usually measured in semitones. For example, the interval from G to B is up 4 semitones.
