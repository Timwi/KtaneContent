                    <p>This module has 9 kidney beans on it. Each bean can be tinted red, maroon or dark red. To solve the module, you must consume three valid beans (but no more). Eating an incorrect bean will cause a strike. If no valid beans are present, the module will not strike you for eating a different one. Eating more than three beans will also cause a strike but the module will stay solved. <em><strong>Note that you cannot see a bean when it has been eaten.</strong></em></p>

                    <h3>Finding Valid Beans</h3>
                    
                    <p>To find out if a bean is valid or invalid, look at its row and column. Read the row from left to right and the column from top to bottom. Start with a score of 0. If the first bean of the row matches the first bean of the column in colour, or if either of them is eaten, add 1 to the score. Repeat this with the second and third beans of the row and column. If the final score of the bean is 2 or higher, it's valid. Red beans look a bit suspicious though, so don't eat them!</p>
