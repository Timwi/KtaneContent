                    <p>This module has 9 kidney beans on it. Each bean can be tinted red, maroon or dark red. To solve the module, you must consume three valid beans (but no more). Eating an incorrect bean will cause a strike. If no valid beans are present, the module will not strike you for eating a different one. Eating more than three beans will also cause a strike but the module will stay solved. <em><strong>Note that you cannot see a bean when it has been eaten.</strong></em></p>

                    <h3>Finding Valid Beans</h3>
                    
                    <p>To find out if a bean is valid or invalid, compare the colors of its row with its column. Start with a score of 0. If the first entry of its row and column are equal, or if either is eaten, add one. Proceed likewise with the second and third entries. If the final score of the bean is 2 or higher, it is valid. Red beans look a bit suspicious though, so <i>never</i> eat them!</p>
