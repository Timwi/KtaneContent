                <h2>On the Subject of Hole in One</h2>
                <p class="flavour-text">Why are sports becoming modules now?</p>
                <p>On the module, there will be a selection of clubs to start the module out. When you use the correct club, you are then presented with a selection of colored golf balls. After you pick the correct golf ball, you will have to decide what kind of power will get a hole in one.</p>
                <p>To find the correct club, use the number of solved modules in <a href="#Table1">Table 1</a> as the column and go through the list of conditions. Each condition has a number associated with it. Add up the numbers for each condition that is true, modulo 5. The result is the position of the club you must select. After selecting, proceed to the next paragraph.</p>
                <p>When at the golf ball selection screen, you are presented with 5 balls, with colors that have RGB components. Find each color component of each ball, take the number of each "Red", "Green", and "Blue" component and multiply them (if any are 0, ignore them). Reference the color chart on page 2 if your confused on separating colors to their RGB components. Modulo this number by 5 and use it as the position of the ball to select. After selecting, proceed to the next paragraph.</p>
                <p>Now you're ready to swing for a hole in one! To do so, use both numbers you got from the previous 2 selections. Let the first number be the column and the second number be the row and use them in <a href="#Table2">Table 2</a>. The letter you get will be decrypted in the following way: </p>
                <ol>
                    <li>Take the letter you got from the table and apply a forward Caesar shift (A -&gt; Z) to the letter using the number you got when calculating the club position.</li>
                    <li>Take the Caesar shifted letter and apply an Atbash cipher to the letter.</li>
                    <li>Convert the letter to its alphanumerical position.</li>
                </ol>
                <p>After you find the power for the hole in one, increase the number on the bottom of the module till it displays the number you got from the above steps. </p>
                <p>If you get a hole in one, the module will solve.</p>
                <p>If anything is wrong, you will not get a hole in one and the module will strike and reset to the start.</p>
