                <h2>On the Subject of The Square Button</h2>
                <p class="flavour-text">This may look like the button you know and love, but don't be fooled! It's a brilliantly disguised imposter foiled only by a single mistake: It's the wrong shape.</p>
                Follow these rules in the order they are listed. Perform the first action that applies:
                <ol>
                    <li>If the button is blue and the number of AA batteries is larger than the number of D batteries, hold the button and refer to "Releasing a Held Button".</li>
                    <li>If the button is yellow or blue and has as at least as many letters on the label as the highest number in the serial, press and immediately release.</li>
                    <li>If the button is yellow or blue and the label states a colour, hold the button and refer to "Releasing a Held Button".</li>
                    <li>If the button has no label, press and immediately release when the two seconds digits on the timer match.</li>
                    <li>If the button is not dark grey and the number of letters on the label is larger than the number of lit indicators, press and immediately release.</li>
                    <li>If there are at least 2 unlit indicators and the serial contains a vowel, press and immediately release.</li>
                    <li>If no other rule applies, hold the button and refer to "Releasing a Held Button".</li>
                </ol>

                <h3>Releasing a Held Button</h3>
                If you start holding the button down, a coloured LED will light up on the right side of the button case. Based on its colour, follow the rules below:
                <ul>
                    <li><em>Cyan:</em> Release when the two seconds digits add up to 7.</li>
                    <li><em>Orange:</em> Release when the two seconds digits add up to 3 or 13.</li>
                    <li><em>Other:</em> Release when the two seconds digits add up to 5.</li>
                </ul>
                If the LED is flickering, follow these rules instead:
                <ul>
                    <li><em>Cyan:</em> Release when the number of seconds remaining is a multiple of 7.</li>
                    <li><em>Orange:</em> Release when the number of seconds displayed is either prime or 0.</li>
                    <li><em>Other:</em> Release one second after the two seconds digits add up to a multiple of 4.</li>
                </ul>
