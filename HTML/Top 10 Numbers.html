                <h2>On the Subject of Top 10 Numbers</h2>
                <p class="flavour-text">Back with a classic that is backkick! (Note: Not actually a backkick.)</p>

                <p>Top 10 Numbers has two displays, and 10 buttons from 1 through 10. Through doing the module, you will create a top X of the numbers 1 through 10.</p>
                <p>
                    After every <a href="../More/Ignore Table.html#mod=top10nums">non-ignored solve</a>, and at the start of the bomb, the module will update both displays. The left display is the stage, ticking
                    down from the amount of unignored modules, and the right is that <strong>stage’s number</strong>.
                </p>
                <p>
                    The <strong>answer</strong> for each stage is the position in the Number Priority given by the <strong>stage’s number</strong>, unless the <strong>stage’s number</strong> is RED, in which case the
                    <strong>answer</strong> is always the first in Number Priority.
                </p>
                <p>The Number Priority starts with the numbers 1 through 10 in ascending order.</p>
                <p>After a number is picked from the Number Priority, it is moved to the back, and all numbers before it
                    are moved forwards.</p>
                <p>If the number is RED, it is time to forget your old preferences and dislike one or two numbers.</p>
                <p>
                    If a disliked number were to be picked for the list, the number closer to the first number in the Number Priority is picked instead until a non-disliked number is picked. If the first number is
                    disliked and picked, pick it anyway.
                </p>
                <p>Reference this table with the red number to determine which conditions to use for the numbers to dislike. (Positions that are 1 are used)</p>
                <table>
                    <tr><th>1</th><th>2</th><th>3</th><th>4</th><th>5</th><th>6</th><th>7</th><th>8</th><th>9</th><th>10</th></tr>
                    <tr><th>0001</th><th>0010</th><th>0011</th><th>0100</th><th>0101</th><th>0110</th><th>1000</th><th>1001</th><th>1010</th><th>1100</th></tr>
                </table>
                <ul>
                    <li>1st - The last number picked for the Top 10 Numbers list.</li>
                    <li>2nd - The first number in Number Priority.</li>
                    <li>3rd - The least common <strong>answer</strong>, with ties broken by the latest in the Number Priority.</li>
                    <li>4th - The most common <strong>answer</strong>, with ties broken by the earliest in the Number Priority.</li>
                </ul>
                <p>
                    Once you have every <strong>answer</strong>, input them all in the order you obtained them by pressing the corresponding button. Upon a strike, the module will re-display the <strong>stage’s
                    number</strong> for that stage.
