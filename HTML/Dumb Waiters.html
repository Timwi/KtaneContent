						<li>8 players, including yourself, are participating in a game of <i>Trivia Murder Party 2</i> and have encountered a “Dumb Waiters” minigame.</li>
						<li>Dumb Waiters consists of two elevators. Each player must anonymously pick one elevator. If everyone picks the same elevator, or the elevators are perfectly balanced, everybody will survive. If that is not the case, everybody in the elevator with more people will die.</li>
						<li>The 7 other players have their names displayed along the top and bottom of the module.</li>
						<li>Every player has made their decision except for you, and your pick will end the game.</li>
						<li>Make the choice that will cause you to survive.</li>
