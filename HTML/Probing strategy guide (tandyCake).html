                <ul>
                <li>Each wire has one value from 10, 22, 50, and 60.</li>
                  <li>To determine the value of a wire, connect it to every other wire and take the value which appears on the screen every time. Ignore the connections which make nothing appear.</li>
                  <li>Once one wire's value is determined, others can be determined by connecting the known wire to the other.
                  <ul>
                    <li>One of the values will be the known value. The other is the value of the unknown wire.</li>
                    <li>If the display appears blank, the unknown wire has the same value as the known wire.</li>
                  </ul></li>
                  </ul>

                  <p>Wires are ordered from left to right, then top to bottom. Values are represented by their first digit.</p>
                  <ul>
                    <li>If wire #<em>1</em>'s value is <em>1, 2, or 6</em>, connect the 1st clip to a wire with value <em>5</em>.</li>
                    <li>Otherwise, if Wire #<em>5</em>'s value is <em>1</em>, connect the 1st clip to wire #<em>5</em>.</li>
                    <li>Otherwise, connect the 1st clip to a wire with value <em>6</em>.</li>
                  </ul>
                  <ul>
                    <li>If wire #<em>5</em>'s value is <em>2, 5, or 6</em>, connect the 2nd clip to a wire with value <em>2</em>.</li>
                    <li>Otherwise, connect the 2nd clip to a wire with value <em>6</em>.</li>
