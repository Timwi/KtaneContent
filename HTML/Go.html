    <h2>On the Subject of Go</h2>

    <p>This module contains a Go board and various black or white stones randomly placed on the points board. Determine which color goes first and who should place stones that would result in a capture.</p>
    <h3>Determining who goes first</h3>
    <ul>
    <li>Take the stones around the border of the board and count the number of stones of each color.</li>
    <li>If there are more black stones around the border than white stones, black must go first.</li>
    <li>If there are more white stones around the border than black stones, white must go first.</li>
    <li>Click any stone of the desired color to select who goes first.</li>
    </ul>
    <h3>Determining the starting position</h3>
    <ul>
    <li>Take the third digit of the serial number. This is the column in which the stone must be placed in. (from left to right)</li>
    <li>Take the sixth digit of the serial number. This is the row in which the stone must be placed in. (from top to bottom)</li>
    <li>If either number is zero, you may place the stone in any position of that row or column.</li>
    <li>Place the stone in the desired position.</li>
    <li>After the first stone has been placed, if you need to see whose turn it is, click on any stone, and the indicated player's stones will be highlighted.</li>
    </ul>
    <h3>Capturing stones</h3>
    <ul>
    <li>If the battery count is even, black must capture. If it is odd, white must capture.  If the wrong color captures, a strike will be incurred and the board will reset.</li>
    <li>A stone or group of stones is captured and removed from the board when all the intersections directly orthogonal to it are occupied by the other color's stones.</li>
    <li>A self capture is a capture in which a stone placed by a player results in that own player being captured. This is always an illegal move.  Even if this results in the correct color getting the capture, a strike will be incurred, and the board will reset.</li>
    </ul>
