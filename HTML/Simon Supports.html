                <h2>On the Subject of Simon Supports</h2>
                <p class="flavour-text">Last meeting we brought up the lack of color within the office. Now the office looks like a Christmas light factory.</p>

                <p>This module will display a series of five LEDs, surrounding a large square projector screen. These LEDs represent the tie colors of five of your fellow co-workers, who all happen to be named Simon. The projector screen will show a sequence of three descriptors for a new module, followed by a brief intermission. However, your co-workers are all playing a sick joke on you, and thus you are unable to see the screen.</p>

                  <p>To disarm the module, correctly offer your accurate opinions on each topic being presented. To do this, press the projector screen when a topic you agree with is being shown to second your agreeing co-workers. Your answer will submit at the end of the sequence. If you agree with none of the topics shown, press the screen during the intermission.</p>
                
                <p>Since the projector can’t be seen, the topics shown must be inferred from the reactions of your co-workers, whose lights will flash whenever an opinion that they agree with is shown. Information on your co-workers’ likes is displayed in the below table.</p>
                
                <p>Once the topics have been determined, use its condition in Table B to determine whether you agree with it.</p>
