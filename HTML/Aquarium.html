                <p class="flavour-text">If there is magic on this planet, it is contained in water.</p>
                <p>The module displays a 6 by 6 grid divided into blocks called “tanks”.</p>
                <p>You have to “fill” the tanks with water up to a certain level or leave it empty.</p>
                <p>The water level in each tank is one and the same across its full width.</p>
                <p>The numbers outside the grid show the number of filled cells horizontally and vertically. Not all numbers are given.</p>
                <p>All the tanks with water (in blue) and all the tanks with air (in white) must be toggled.  Click on a square to cycle it between unfilled, water, and air.</p>
                <p>If you wish to reset the puzzle, you may press the red button.</p>
                <p>The module will disarm once all the appropriate cells have been filled in with either water or air.</p>
