                <p class="flavour-text">PUSH IT PUSH IT PUSH IT PUSH IT PUSH IT PUSH IT PUSH IT PUSH IT PUSH IT</p>

                <p>Push the button. Just push it, you know you want to. Come on, push it! Do it! Now! The bomb will blow if you don't push the button! Just do it! What are you waiting for?! Push the damn button! It's a fact that you want to push it, and you know it, so just do it! Are you TRYING to lose? PUSH. IT. NOW. ...OH MY GOD, WHAT IN THE WORLD ARE YOU DOING?! WHY ARE YOU IGNORING THE BUTTON?! JUST PUSH IT ALREADY!</p>
                <p>...</p>
                <p>Waiting...</p>
                <p>Stiiiiil waitiiiiiing......</p>
                <p>Oh, you pushed it! Great job, you won!</p>
                <p>...Wait, you didn't press it?</p>
                <p>DID YOU JUST LIE TO ME?</p>
                <p>I'M TELLING YOU THE TRUTH BUT YOU DON'T BELIEVE ME? YOU HAVE GOT TO BE KIDDING ME RIGHT NOW.</p>
                <p>Fine. I'll keep waiting. My patience is starting to run out, though, so hurry up and press the button already.</p>
                <p>...</p>
                <p>..........</p>
                <p>You still don't get it, do you? You need to press the button, and you win. What's so hard about that?!</p>
                <p>Let me make myself as clear as possible.</p>
                <h3>PUSH. THE. BUTTON.</h3>
                <p>Do you understand me now?</p>
                <p>Good. Now push the button.</p>
                <p>Though, honestly, you really shouldn't have taken long enough that you could read all of this.</p>
