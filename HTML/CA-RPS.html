                <h2>On the Subject of CA-RPS</h2>
                <p class="flavour-text">"Funny fish module." -<i>You know who you are.</i></p>
                <p>On the module is an 8 by 6 grid. Each cell in this grid can be either Rock (Red), Paper (Green), Scissors (Blue), or empty.</p>
                <p>The state of each cell in the initial grid is changed by number of rocks, papers, and scissors amongst its eight* neighbouring cells:</p>
                <ul><li>If the cell is empty:<ul>
                <li>If all neighbouring cells are empty or there is a three-way tie, the cell remains empty.</li>
                <li>Otherwise if there is a two-way tie, the state of the cell is changed to the state that wins against the other.</li>
                <li>Otherwise, the state of the cell is changed to the most abundant state of the neighbouring cells.</li></ul>
                <li>If the cell is not empty:
                <ul><li>If the cell wins against at least as many of its neighbours than it loses against, the state of cell remains unchanged.</li>
                <li>Otherwise, the state of the cell is changed to the state that wins against its current state.</li></ul></li></ul>
                <p>*The edges of the grid wrap around to the opposite side, therefore every cell in the grid has eight neighbours.</p>
                <p>To change the state of a cell in the grid:</p>
                <ol><li>Press the rock, paper, or scissor button.<br>
                Select a state that is already selected to change the selected state to empty. The empty state is selected by default.</li>
                <li>Select a cell in the grid to change its state to the one selected.</li></ol>
                <ul><li>The clear button changes the state of all cells to empty.</li>
                <li>The reset button changes the states of all cells to their original state.</li>
                <li>The submit button is pressed to check the current configuration of the cells in the grid against the expected final configuration.<br>The module is defused if the configurations match. Otherwise, a strike is incurred.</li></ul>
