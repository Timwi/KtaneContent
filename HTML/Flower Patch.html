                <p>There are 15 flowers displayed on the module which can be shown in 8 colors: red, orange, yellow, green, blue, indigo, violet and white.
                    Use the Venn diagram and the table afterward to determine which flowers to select. If an incorrect flower is selected, a strike will occur.
