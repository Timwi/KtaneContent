                <h2>On the Subject of Fractal Maze</h2>
                <p class="flavour-text">How is one supposed to solve an infinite maze?</p>
                <p>The module displays 3 squares and a diamond segmented into 4 smaller directional diamonds. In order to solve the module, travel through the different iterations of the fractal, and reduce it to the -1'st iteration.</p>
                <p>The 3 shown squares and the empty corner are part of a 2×2 grid. This 2×2 grid is your seed and your starting grid (or iteration 0). To iterate the grid, create a copy of the current grid and place it within each non-empty quadrant of the seed. Then apply the transformation corresponding to the colour of that quadrant</p>
                <p>The first maze to use is the third iteration, having a length and width of 16 squares. Each time you solve a maze, the next maze to solve will be the maze of the previous iteration. Repeat this until i0 is completed.</p>
                <p>To navigate, use the diamond. This diamond also shows your location and the location of the goal through its flashes. There will be a number of flashes corresponding to your current iteration plus one. The red flashes refer to your starting position, while the green flashes refer to your goal position. If these flashes overlap, the intersection will be yellow. 
                  <p>To determine what cells the flashes refer to. Take both colours. Each colour in each flash will show an edge of the diamond. These correspond to the four quadrants of the grid. For each colour, take the quadrant of the first flash, and then take the sub-quadrant that's in the position of the second flash. Repeat this with the other flashes until a single cell is targetted.
                <p>Each colour has as mentioned a transformation connected to it. To obtain this transformation, divide each colour into its RGB components. Colours with R=1 are Red, Magenta, Yellow, and White. Colours with G=1 are Green, Cyan, Yellow, and White. Colours with B=1 are Blue, Cyan, Magenta, and White.</p>
                <p>If a colour has R=1, the grid will be flipped vertically. If a colour has G=1, the grid will be flipped horizontally. If a colour has B=1, the grid will be rotated 90 degrees clockwise. All applying conditions must be executed in this order.</p>
