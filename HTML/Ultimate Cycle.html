                <p class="flavour-text">How much security does one word need?</p>
                <p>This module consists of a screen, eight dials with red labels, and a QWERTY keyboard.</p>
                <p>The labels on the dials, when decrypted and read from left to right, spell out an eight letter word.</p>
                <p>The word has been encrypted through a series of ciphers, indicated by the direction each dial is pointing, from left to right.</p>
                <p>Once deciphered, find the word in the table below, the word written below it is the word that should be entered.</p>
                <p>Apply the same sequence of encryptions to the response word, and type out the encrypted response word using the keys.</p>
                <p>The word is automatically submitted when eight keys are pressed.</p>
                <p>The red button can be pressed at any time before the eighth key is pressed to cancel the input.</p>
                <p>Inputting any of the eight letters incorrectly will cause a strike to be issued and reset the module.</p>
                <p>Note: Unless stated otherwise, any reference to a letter’s alphabetic position starts at A = 1. Similarly, any reference to the position of a dial starts from the leftmost dial = 1.</p>
