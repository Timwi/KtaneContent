                    <p class="flavour-text">How much security does one word need?</p>
				<p>This module consists of a screen, eight dials with red labels, and a QWERTY keyboard.</p>
				<p>The labels on the dials, when decrypted and read from left to right, spell out an eight letter word.</p>
				<p>The word has been encrypted through a series of ciphers, indicated by the direction each dial is pointing, from left to right.</p>
				<p>Once deciphered, find the word in the table below, the word written below it is the word that should be entered.</p>
				<p>Apply the same sequence of encryptions to the response word, and type out the encrypted response word using the keys.</p>
				<p>The word is automatically submitted when eight keys are pressed.</p>
				<p>The red button can be pressed at any time before the eighth key is pressed to cancel the input.</p>
				<p>Inputting any of the eight letters incorrectly will cause a strike to be issued and reset the module.</p>   
                <p>Note: Unless stated otherwise, any reference to a letter's alphabetic position starts at A = 1. Similarly, any reference to the position of a dial starts from the leftmost dial = 1.</p>

				<p>The alphabetic positions of the letters in the keyword modulo 26 form the entries of a 2x2 square keymatrix in reading order.
				<br>If the LED corresponding to this cipher is lit, the matrix is then transposed, swapping its top-right and bottom-left entries.
				<br>The word to be enciphered is broken into four pairs of letters and their alphabetic positions modulo 26 form entries in 2x1 vectors.
				<br>The vectors are multiplied by the keymatrix and taken modulo 26 to obtain the alphabetic positions of the encrypted pairs of letters.

				<font size = "2">
				<p>The following rule is used to uniquely assign each dial from left to right with a number from 1 to 8:</p>
				<ul><li>If unassigned, assign the number of 45&deg; rotations of the dial, starting from north, plus one.</li>
				    <li>Otherwise, if the LED corresponding to the dial is lit, assign the highest unassigned number to it.</li>
					<li>Otherwise, assign the lowest unassigned number to it.</li></ul>
				<p>Each number in this sequence from left to right corresponds to a letter in the word in reading order.</p>
				<p>If the LED corresponding to this cipher is lit, the word is rearranged such that the numbers corresponding to each letter are in ascending order
				<br>Otherwise, the word is rearranged such that the numbers corresponding to each letter are in descending order.</p>
				<p>The rearranged word is then cyclically shifted such that the first letter of the encrypted word is the letter whose corresponding number is the position of the dial corresponding to this cipher.</p>
