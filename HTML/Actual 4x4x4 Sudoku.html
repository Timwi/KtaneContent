                <h2>Actually On the Subject of 4×4×4 Sudoku</h2>
                <p class="flavour-text">You think he’d learn his lesson on making puzzle modules with ambiguous solutions. Now, he’s making nerfed versions of another module, and still hasn’t learned his lesson.</p>
                <p>On this module is a 4×4×4 grid. Each cell may contain one of four solids: Tetrahedron, Hexahedron, Octahedron, or Dodecahedron. These solids are color coded for convenience.</p>
                <p>
                    Each row, column, stack, and 2×2 squares projected from the X, Y, and Z planes of the cube may only contain one of each shape.<br>
                    There is only one arrangement of solids that fits within the constraints with the given starting configuration.
                </p>
                <p>
                    Navigate around the cube using the four buttons at the top of the module.<br>
                    Pressing any one will move the cell selector one space in its direction, wrapping around if it exits the grid.<br>
                    The coordinates of the selector are shown on the buttons, in addition to the M selector.<br>
                    The M selector will display 2D projections of the provided plane from the cube provided, by omitting projections of the X, Y, or Z axis.
                </p>
                <p>
                    If the selected cell is empty, a white sphere will be visible inside it,<br>
                    otherwise the button with the solid in the selected cell will be highlighted.<br>
                    Pressing one of the four buttons to the right of the module will place its corresponding solid in the selected empty cell.<br>
                    An incorrect solid placed an empty cell can be overridden by selecting another solid or cleared by selecting the highlighted solid.
                    Cells whose solids have a gray highlight CANNOT be overridden nor cleared.<br>
                    To reset the entire module to the beginning, hold any of the solids for around 2 seconds on a cell without a gray outline.
                </p>
                <p>The module is solved once all cells are correctly filled.</p>
