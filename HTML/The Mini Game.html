                <h2>On the Subject of The Mini Game</h2>
                <p class="flavour-text">The machine might be smaller in scope than the other one, but it makes up for it in massive loss of time.</p>

                <p>This machine contains 2 square displays. You can’t interact with any of the displays.</p>
                <p>When the machine activates, the 2 square displays will light up and show numbers. There will be also static noise that will be produced while the machine is active. The minigame will last <b>3–5</b> turns (+1 extra free turn that you will always get at the end of the game). To temporarily solve the machine, follow the rules located on <a href="https://ktane.timwi.de/HTML/The Number Game.html"><b>"The Number Game"</b></a> manual.</p>
                <p>There are a lot of things that differ from this machine and its counterpart:</p>
                <ul>
                <li><b>The left display</b> will initially show a blinking number between <b>10–99</b>. This will be the <b>maximum number</b> that the machine will accept.</li>
                <li><b>The right display</b> will show the number remaining on the minigame. The number will be subtracted by the number you and the computer chose during each player’s turn.</li>
                </ul>
                <p>When you type a number on the keyboard while the left display number is flashing, the flashing number will be replaced by the number you have typed. You can erase the number you have typed by pressing the <b>"Backspace"</b> key on the keyboard. When the number you have typed is fully erased, the blinking number will return to the display. You can only type 2 digits maximum on the left display.</p>
                <p>You can submit the number you have typed by pressing the <b>"Enter"</b> key on the keyboard. This will be the number you submit on your turn. If any mistake occurs, the machine will immediately halt and give you a strike. Look at the <a href="https://ktane.timwi.de/HTML/The Number Game.html"><b>"ERROR MEANING"</b></a> part of the manual to locate the mistake that occured (which can only be seen on the machine log).</p>
