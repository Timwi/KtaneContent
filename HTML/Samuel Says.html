                    This module houses a device with a large color display above four colored buttons, with a
                    smaller display and a gray button to the right.
                </p>

                <p>
                    <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Samuel_Morse" target="_blank" style="text-decoration: none">
                        Samuel Finley Breese Morse
                    </a>
                    has been trapped in this device and needs your help to escape! Fortunately, he is also the creator
                    of the device and knows how to get out. Unfortunately however, his only means of communication is
                    through colored morse. Your job is to transmit different colored symbols to help him disarm the
                    module.
                </p>

                <p>
                    Good luck! Press the gray button to start. From now on, unless stated otherwise, the gray button will
                    mute/unmute the device. Pressing the small display will toggle colorblind mode. The buttons are always
                    red, yellow, green, blue, left-to-right.
                </p>

                <h3>Stages 1-4</h3>

                <p class="sh">
                    In these first four stages, take Samuel’s transmitted messages and modify them to
                    produce one colored symbol (per stage), which you then transmit back to him. Remember the colors of
                    these symbols; you’ll need them for the final stage.
                </p>

                <h4>Sequence Modification</h4>

                <p class="sh">
                    Each stage, go through the colors in the <b>displayed sequence</b>, in the flashed order, and go to
                    the corresponding table below. Find the first true <b>condition</b> in the table and look at the
                    corresponding <b>action</b>.
                </p>

                <p>
                    Actions must only be applied once <i>per stage</i>; if this action has not been applied yet, apply
                    it to the <b>modified sequence</b>, which starts off identical to the displayed sequence. Otherwise,
                     move <i>up</i> through the table, wrapping back to the bottom row if needed, until
                    you reach an action that has not yet been applied, and apply it.

                <h4>Determining Position</h4>

                <p>
                    The correct position to submit is X, modulo(✲✲) the length of the modified sequence,
                    plus one, where the value of X depends on the current stage:
                </p>

                <ul>
                    <li>In stage 1, X is the number of batteries.</li>
                    <li>In stage 2, X is the number of ports.</li>
                    <li>In stage 3, X is the number of indicators.</li>
                    <li>In stage 4, X is the number of modules on the bomb.</li>
                </ul>

                <p class="footnote">
                    ✲✲ To modulo a number Y by a number X is to repeatedly add or subtract X from Y until the result is
                    between 0 and
                    (X-1), inclusive.
                </p>

                <h4>Submission</h4>

                <p>
                    To submit a colored symbol, press the button of the relevant color. To submit a
                    dash, hold the button until the small display on the right shows a <code>ー</code>;
                    to submit a dot, release the button before this happens.
                </p>

                <p>
                    If the submission is correct, Samuel will accept the response and attempt to transmit
                    a new sequence. However, the device is riddled with oddities, so a <b>quirk</b> may show
                    up after each stage. Read the next subsection for more information.
                </p>

                <p>
                    If the submission is incorrect, Samuel will not accept the response, and the module will strike.
                    The displayed sequence and correct response will remain the same.
                </p>

                <h4>Quirks</h4>

                <p>
                    If a quirk appears after a correct submission, Samuel will exhibit some visual indicator
                    of the quirk. Respond in the correct way to nullify the quirk and move on to the next stage.
                    Remember which quirks show up, as you’ll need them for the final stage.
                </p>

                <p>An incorrect response will cause a strike and reset input.</p>

                <h3>Stage 5</h3>

                <p>
                    After four correct submissions, Samuel needs an entire word to be transmitted, so he
                    can use it to finally escape the device and disarm the module. Note that, visually,
                    there is no difference between this stage and the previous four.
                </p>

                <h4>Determining the Word</h4>

                <p>
                    Take only the symbols in the displayed sequence, ignoring the colors. If this sequence
                    does not form a valid morse letter, the correct word is <code>SAMUEL</code>.
                </p>

                <p>Otherwise, modify the sequence based on the quirk(s) that appeared earlier:</p>
                <ul><li>If no quirks appeared, leave the sequence as is.</li></ul>

            </div>
            <div class="page-footer relative-footer">4</div>
        </div>

        <div class="page page-bg-05">
            <div class="page-header">
                <span class="page-header-doc-title">Keep Talking and Nobody Explodes Mod</span>
                <span class="page-header-section-title">Samuel Says</span>
            </div>
            <div class="page-content">
                <ul>
                    <li>If only one quirk appeared, remove the first position.</li>
                    <li>If only two quirks appeared, and they were different, shift the sequence to the right by two.</li>
                    <li>If only two of the same quirk appeared, reverse the sequence.</li>
                    <li>If three different quirks appeared, remove the first three positions.</li>
                    <li>If three quirks appeared, and only two were the same, remove the third position.</li>
                    <li>If three of the same quirk appeared, remove the first two positions.</li>
                </ul>

                <p>If the sequence is now empty, or does not form a valid morse letter, use <code>MORSE</code> as the word.</p>

                <p>
                    Otherwise, convert the sequence into a letter and take this letter’s spelling in the NATO
                    Phonetic Alphabet to use as the word. (✲✲✲)
                </p>

                <p class="footnote">✲✲✲ See <b><u>Appendix-MORSE-NATO</u></b> for more information.</p>

                <h4>Submission</h4>

                <p>
                    Convert the entire word into morse code, without any breaks between letters.
                    Input these symbols into the module, using the color submitted in stage 1
                    for the first symbol, the color submitted in stage 2 for the second symbol,
                    and so on. Wrap back around to stage 1 upon running out of stages.
                </p>

                <p>
                    For example, if the final word is <code>QUEBEC</code>, and the colors submitted in the
                    previous stages were red, green, blue, blue, the correct response for this stage would be
                </p>

                <p class="centered"><code>--.- ..- . -... . -.-.<br>RGBB RGB B RGBB R GBBR</code></p>

                <p>(note that the spaces are only for clarity, and should be ignored during input).</p>

                <p>
                    After submitting each complete letter, Samuel will display the letter on the small screen to confirm
                    he has received it.
                </p>

                <p>Correctly submitting the entire word will release Samuel from his prison and solve the module.</p>

                <p>
                    Upon submitting an incorrect symbol, the module will strike and the buttons will flash the
                    expected color order one time. Input will be reset but the displayed sequence and answer will
                    not change.
