                <p>This module seems very straightforward at first. And it is. However! Due to some concerning employee care for this module, the wiring has been damaged.</p>
                <p>In order to disarm this module, use the chart located below to find the correct button to press.</p>
                <p>Go through the table from top to bottom, and follow the first rule that applies.</p>
                <h3>Rule Table</h3>
                <table>
                    <tr>
                        <th>Edgework</th>
                        <th>Button to press</th>
                    </tr>
                    <tr>
                        <th>≥ 3 Batteries</th>
                        <td>
                            Strike
                        </td>
                    </tr>
                    <tr>
                        <th>Parallel Port Present</th>
                        <td>Solve, however, if an RJ port is <i>also</i> present, press Strike.</td>
                    </tr>
                    <tr>
                        <th>Otherwise</th>
                        <td>Solve</td>
                    </tr>
                </table>
                <p>However, if there is a lit BOB, and there are 2 or more batteries, lucky you! Bob has already fixed the wiring. Click either button.</p>
