                    <h2>On the Subject of Survey Says</h2>
                    <p class="flavour-text">I bet you never thought about which modules *actually* use “port plates” and not just ports.</p>
                    <p>On the module are four colored buzzers, one each colored Rose, Jade, Orange, and Violet</p>
                    <p>The Survey has chosen a module from the Repository of Manual Pages to “survey”.</p>
                    <p>With its (albeit very limited) survey, The Survey learns what edgework the module uses, as well as its scores and difficulties.</p>
                    <p>Pressing pairs of buttons will cause The Survey to tell you a certain aspect of the surveyed module.</p>
                    <p>To solve the module, figure out what module was surveyed, do the same query twice in a row to enter submission, then spell out the module’s name.</p>
                    <p>The Survey will continue to take letters until at least 5 letters have been typed, and the name is unique. If the name of the correct module is fully spelled, it will solve then.</p>
                    <br>
                    <p>This module supports modules made up to July 2nd, 2017, with the latest module being Yahtzee.</p>
                    <br>
                    <p>Y is never considered to be a vowel.</p>
                    <p>To encode a difficulty, from “very easy” to “very hard”, the colors would be as follows: Jade, Orange, Violet, Rose, All.</p>
                    <p>
                        To encode letters and numbers into flashes, see the following: For letters, change them to their alphabetical position, and for numbers, use them as is. Convert that number to binary, then split it
                        into sets of 4 from the least significant bit (if a section has less than 4, prepend 0s). For each set of 4, if the position in the following list is a 1, that color will be on: Rose, Orange,
                        Violet, Jade. When flashing colors, the Survey will flash the most significant set first.<br>(Example: R = 18 = 10010 => 0001 0010, would flash Jade, then Violet.)
