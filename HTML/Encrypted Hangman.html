                    <h2>On the Subject of Encrypted Hangman</h2>
                    <p class="flavour-text">You can't tell me this harmless school game doesn't encourage suicide... But everyone loves it.</p>
                <p><h3>Module description:</h3> <br>The module consists of 2 arrow button which are located on the top of the 
                module. Between those is a screen with a letter displayed on it. Beneath that are a bunch of underscores. On the right there will be a hangman displayed,
                 but only if you interact with the module. The background looks like a blackboard.</p>
                 
                 <p><h3>How to solve the module:</h3> <br>Literally play Hangman! BUT the message is encoded. To solve the module you will have to figure out what the encoded message is.
                 When all letters have been submitted and no underscores are left on the screen,
                  the module solves. You must accomplish this before the hangman is done. The gallow has 4 pieces of wood and the hangman itself consists of a head, a body, 2 legs and 2 arms. So you have 9 wrong queries before the hangman is done. (It will strike on the tenth)
                  Finishing the hangman will incur a strike and will reset the module. Any wrong letters will not be recorded by the module like in the regular game.</p>
                    <p><h3>What is the message? </h3><br>
                    The message is always the name of a module, which is on this bomb. But the message is encoded using one of the many famous ciphers.
                    Ciphers will always use a key which is determined using edgework. To find out which key is belonging to what cipher refer to the table below.
                    The name is the full name (including "the") but without any spaces or any other special characters such as  - * ! % '. Due to that fact that the
                    chalkboard is not large enough only a maximum of 24 letters will be displayed and will be needed to submit. The additional letters will be displayed in that case.</p>

                <p><strong>WARNING!</strong> <br>
                Be careful with solving any modules. If you solve any instance of a module which is used as the original message of THIS module, you will receive a strike and the module will reset.
                So solve this one first or figure out which module it is referring to. 
                Some modules which are time based are ignored from the solving rule, but they can still appear as the message. *If one or more Organization modules are on the bomb disregard this section of rules.</p>
