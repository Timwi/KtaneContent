                <h2>On the Subject of Encrypted Hangman</h2>
                <p class="flavour-text">You can’t tell me this harmless school game doesn’t encourage suicide... But everyone loves it.</p>
                <h3>Module description:</h3>
                <p>The module consists of 2 arrow buttons which are located on the top of the
                module. Between those is a screen with a letter displayed on it. Beneath that are a bunch of underscores. On the right a hangman will appear when you interact with the module. The background looks like a blackboard.</p>

                <h3>How to solve the module:</h3>
                <p>Literally play Hangman! BUT the message is encoded. To solve the module, figure out what the encoded message is. You can do this by looking what module has the required amount of letters or by querying some letters.</p>
                <p>When all letters have been submitted and no underscores are left on the screen, the module solves. This must be accomplished before the hangman is completed. The gallows has 4 pieces of wood and the hangman itself consists of a head, a body, 2 legs and 2 arms. This means a 10th wrong query will incur a strike.</p>
                <p>A strike will reset the module. Any wrong letters are not recorded.</p>
                <h3>What is the message?</h3>
                <p>The message is always the name of a module* on the same bomb. But the message is encoded using one of 7 ciphers listed on the next page. The cipher may use a key which is determined by edgework, as described in the table.</p>
                <p>The name is the full name (including “the”) but without any spaces or any numbers or any other special characters such as - * ! % ’. Since the chalkboard is not very large, only a maximum of 24 letters are displayed and will need to be submitted. Any additional letters are displayed in that case.</p>

                <p><strong>WARNING:</strong> Hangman must be disarmed before any instance of the module identified by its message. Solving any matching module before Hangman incurs a strike and the module will reset. Some modules listed on the last page are exempt from this even if they appear as the message.</p>

                        Each letter has a specific value which you can find in the <a href="Vigen%C3%A8re%20Cipher.html">Vigenére Cipher manual</a>.

                        This cipher uses numbers too. If the message or the key has numbers leave them as they are. If numbers occur in the encrypted message they will be substituted with A0J9.
