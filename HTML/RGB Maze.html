                <h2>On the Subject of RGB Mazes</h2>
                <p class="flavour-text">Now you too can experience getting lost three times simultaneously!</p>

                <p>This module consists of an 8x8 grid of LEDs and a seven segment display.</p>
                <p>On this 8x8 grid are three mazes:<br>one with red walls, one with green, and one with blue.<br>
                   Each of these mazes contains a key. All three of these keys are initially shown on the grid.</p>
                <p>The seven segment display shows three numbers that correspond to each of the mazes, which also overlap and mix additively.</p>
                <p>Pressing any of the LEDs will reveal the starting location, a white LED, somewhere within the red maze. The keys are then hidden but will not be moved from their original locations.</p>
                <p>Press an adjacent grey LED to move. Attempting to move to a space where:<ul>
                   <li>there is a wall between the white and selected grey LEDs...</li>
                   <li>a key belonging to a different maze lies...</li></ul>
                   will cause a strike.</p>
                <p>Press the white LED to switch between mazes. This can always be done and will never result in a strike.</p>
                <p>Once all three keys are collected, the seven segment display will change.<br>
                   Each of the three colour components give a coordinate of the location of the exit:
                   <ul><li>One of the components is a number. This gives the row the exit lies in.</li>
                       <li>One of the other components is a letter. This gives the column the exit lies in.</li>
                       <li>The remaining component is a random pattern that is neither a number or a letter.<br> The exit lies in the maze that is the same colour as this component.</li></ul>
                Note: B and D are shown in lowercase to disambiguate them from 8 and 0; the rest of the letters are uppercase.</p>
                <p>In a similar fashion as the keys, the exit can only be used from the maze it lies in. A strike will be incurred if an exit is attempted from a different maze.</p>

                <h3>Maze Layouts</h3>
                <p>Each colour component of the seven segment display is a number corresponding to one of the mazes below.</p>
                <p>Each of the mazes has an LED at one of its corners that is the same colour as the maze itself, identifying the orientation of that maze.<br>
                The mazes may have been flipped horizontally and/or vertically such that the LEDs are flipped onto the appropriate corners of the grid.<br>
                The colours of the LEDs mix additively if their respective mazes have the same orientation.</p>
                <p>Each of the mazes below have their LEDs at the top left corner of the grid.</p>
