                <h2>On the Subject of Tennis</h2>

                <p class="flavour-text">Game, set, and match.</p>

                <ul>
                    <li>The module displays the names of two players and the score table of a tennis match in progress. The names imply whether it’s a women’s or men’s game.</li>
                    <li>Observe the surface of the tennis court to determine which tournament is in progress:
                        <ul>
                            <li><em>Hard court</em> (blue):  <strong>US Open at Flushing Meadows</strong></li>
                            <li><em>Lawn</em> (green):       <strong>The Championships at Wimbledon</strong></li>
                            <li><em>Clay</em> (orange):      <strong>French Open Roland-Garros</strong></li>
                        </ul>
                    </li>
                    <li>Convert each character of the bomb's serial number into a 5-digit binary number (potentially with leading zeros). For letters, use 5 plus the letter’s alphabetic position.</li>
                    <li>Concatenate these into a 30-digit string of binary digits. In this string, a 1 represents a point scored by the serving player, a 0 a point for the opponent.</li>
                    <li>If either player wins the match at any point, click that player’s name and ignore any extraneous binary digits.</li>
                    <li>Otherwise, enter the new score after this sequence of 30 rallies (exchanges).</li>
                    <li>Click any digit box to increment or cycle the score in that box.</li>
                    <li>Click on the first blank set scorebox to add a set.</li>
                    <li>Click the tennis racket to switch between three different modes (0/15/30/40 scoring; deuce/advantage; and tie break).</li>
                    <li>Long-press the number boxes in the center to reset those scores to 0–0.</li>
                    <li>Long-press a score in a set to remove that set and all subsequent sets.</li>
                    <li>Long-press the tennis racket to reset the module to its original scores.</li>
                </ul>

                <h3>Scoring rules</h3>
                <ul>
                    <li>To win a <em>match</em>, a player must win 2 (women’s play) or 3 (men’s play) <em>sets</em>.
                        <ul><li>The scores of each <em>set</em> are displayed at the bottom of the module.</li></ul>
                    </li>
                    <li>To win a <em>set</em>, a player must win at least 6 <em>games</em> with a difference in <em>games</em> of at least 2 from the other player.</li>
                    <li><em>Games</em> within a <em>set</em> are counted in increments of 1.</li>
                </ul>

                <ul>
                    <li>Individual points within a <em>game</em> are notated as follows: 15, 30, 40.
                        <ul><li>These scores are shown in the middle of the module.</li></ul>
                    </li>
                    <li>If both players reach 40, the score is notated as a <em>deuce</em>.
                        <ul><li>In the French Open Roland-Garros, the first 40–40 in a <em>game</em> is notated as 40–40.</li></ul>
                    </li>
                    <li>If a player scores a point while on 40 and the score is not <em>deuce</em> (or 40–40), that player wins the <em>game</em>.</li>
                    <li>If a player scores in a <em>deuce</em> (or 40–40), the score is notated as <em>advantage</em> followed by the name of that player.
                        <ul><li><em>Avantage</em> in the French Open Roland-Garros.</li></ul>
                    </li>
                    <li>If a player scores while they have <em>advantage</em>, that player wins the <em>game</em>.</li>
                    <li>If a player scores while the opponent has <em>advantage</em>, the score returns to <em>deuce</em>.
                        <ul><li>In the French Open Roland-Garros, <em>deuce</em> is instead referred to as <em>égalité</em>.</li></ul>
                    </li>
                    <li>If the score within a <em>set</em> reaches 6–6, a <em>tie break</em> occurs.
                        <ul><li>In Wimbledon and the French Open Roland-Garros, <em>tie breaks</em> are not played in the final deciding <em>set</em> (5th <em>set</em> in men’s play, 3rd <em>set</em> in women’s play); instead, play continues until either player wins the <em>match</em> by achieving a difference in <em>games</em> of 2 from the other player.</li></ul>
                    </li>
                    <li>In a <em>tie break</em>, points for each rally are counted in increments of 1.</li>
                    <li>To win a <em>tie break</em> (and hence, the <em>set</em>), a player must reach 7 points or more with a point difference of at least 2 from their opponent.</li>
                </ul>

                <h3>Service rules</h3>
                <ul>
                    <li>The first <em>game</em> in a <em>match</em> is served by the player listed first on the module.</li>
                    <li>All rallies within a <em>game</em> are served by the same player (except in <em>tie breaks</em>, see below).</li>
                    <li>The serve alternates with every <em>game</em>, even across <em>sets</em>.</li>
                    <li>The first rally in a <em>tie break</em> is served by the player who didn't serve the previous <em>game</em>. Then the serve switches for the second rally. Beginning with the second rally, the serve switches after every two rallies.</li>
                    <li>After a <em>tie break</em>, the first <em>game</em> of the next <em>set</em> is served by the player who didn't serve the first rally in the <em>tie break</em>.</li>
                </ul>
