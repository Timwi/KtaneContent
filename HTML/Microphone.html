                <h2>On the Subject of Microphones</h2>
                <p class="flavour-text">Shhhh, it can hear us.</p>
                <p class="appendix-reference">See Appendix A for indicator identification reference.<br>
                See Appendix C for port identification reference.<br>

                <ul>
                    <li>A microphone is on the left. To disarm the module, it must be destroyed by blowing out its diaphragm.</li>
                    <li>The microphone has built-in security systems that will automatically disable it if it gets overloaded.</li>
                    <li>However, there is a deaf spot between the microphone's blow out point, and the volume at which the security kicks in.</li>
                    <li>To blow out the diaphragm, play a loud sound into the microphone, while manipulating the microphone's recording volume in the correct way.</li>
                    <li>A volume knob is found in the bottom right. It ranges from 0 to 5. Pressing it will increase the recording volume by one. It will loop around back to 0 when going above the maximum; this may cause a strike if done incorrectly.</li>
                    <li>There is also a record button in the top right, which enables/disables the microphone, and a pop filter may be present over the microphone.</li>
                </ul>

                <h4>Examples of loud enough sounds</h4>
                <p>The bomb itself can only produce two sounds loud enough to blow the microphone's diaphragm. These are the <b>striking sound</b>, and the <b>bomb exploding</b>.
                Unfortunately, while more effective at destroying the diaphragm due to internal vibrations caused in the bomb, both of these two sounds come with negative side-effects.
                It is adviced that the defuser instead uses a different device in the room, and not the bomb itself, for the production of the required loud sound.</p>

                <h3>Step one:</h3>
                <p>Calculate the microphone's deaf spot:</p>
                <ol>
                    <li>Take the initial position of the volume knob, marked with a circle.</li>
                    <li>Subtract 1 for each Stereo RCA port on the bomb (Two jacks make one port).</li>
                    <li>If there is a pop filter on the module, add 1. Pop filters can be identified as large round dark-colored filters placed over the microphone.</li>
                    <li>If the value is negative, multiply it by -2.</li>
                    <li>If the value is higher than 5, change it to 0.</li>
                </ol>

                <span class="page-header-doc-title">Keep Talking and Nobody Explodes Mod</span>
                <span class="page-header-section-title">Microphone</span>
            </div>
            <div class="page-content">
                <h3>Step two:</h3>
                <p>If the red LED on the record button is blinking, the module is currently listening in on the defuser. It must be turned off first.
                Pressing the button to do so manually will incur a strike, as will lowering the volume knob.
                The recording must be force-stopped by intentionally causing the microphone's security system to kick in.
                If the LED is already off, this step can be skipped.</p>
                <ol>
                <li>Set the volume knob to above the deaf spot. Set the volume to 5 if the deaf spot is 5; do not attempt to move the volume knob beyond the maximum of 5.</li>
                <li>Play the loud sound. The LED will stop blinking and light up completely.</li>
                <li>Leave the sound playing until the security kicks in. This will stop the recording, indicated by the LED turning off. This can take up to 10 seconds.</li>
                </ol>

                <h3>Step three:</h3>
                <p>With the initial recording stopped, the volume knob can now safely be lowered. From this point on, the security kicking in again will incur a strike.</p>
                <ol>
                    <li>Set the volume knob to the microphone's deaf spot.</li>
                    <li>Press the record button to enable the microphone again. (Blinking LED)</li>
                    <li>Play the loud sound. At this point, if the volume knob is set incorrectly, the recording will stop and a strike will be incurred (in that order).</li>
                    <li>If successful (lit LED), do <b>not</b> stop the sound or touch the volume knob at this point, unless the instructions from step four specify otherwise. Failure to do so will incur a strike for suspicious activity.</li>
                </ol>

                <h3>Step four:</h3>
                <p>With the sound playing, perform the following special instructions in order.</p>
                <ol>
                    <li>If the deaf spot is 5, change it to 4 <b>before</b> ten ticks of the bomb's timer have passed. Leave it there for at least one tick, then change it back to 5.</li>
                    <li>If the deaf spot is 2, change the volume to 3 after at least five ticks of the bomb's timer.</li>
                    <li>If the deaf spot is 1, change the volume to 5 at any point. Leave it there for at least one tick of the bomb's timer and at most three, then set it back to 1.</li>
                    <li>If the deaf spot is 0, the volume knob must be increased by 1 until it reaches the maximum volume of 5. Do this with a speed of at most one increase per tick of the bomb's timer.</li>
                    <li>If there is an SND indicator on the bomb, stop the sound and start it again.</li>
                    <li>The round microphone types will break at this point. Otherwise, the sound must be played for up to 10 more seconds.</li>
                </ol>

                    <li>Voice B: Uhh, it’s red?</li>
                    <li>Voice A: Uhhh, release when there’s a five in any position of the timer.</li>
                    <li>Voice B: Okay. Eight. Seven. Six. F...</li>

                    <li>Voice B: Let me get the manual page for that.</li>
                    <li>[The sound of pages being turned can be heard]</li>
                    <li>Voice B: Oh right, you gotta find the submit button first.</li>
                    <li>Voice A: Roger, I’ll press some random buttons.</li>
                    <li>[The rest of the recording is a series of beeps]</li>

                    <li>Voice A: Are you nuts? I don’t want to get a strike and die.</li>
                    <li>Voice B: Well the other option is to play something else loud. Do you have anything nearby?</li>
                    <li>Voice A: Hmmm. Uhhh. Oh, the alarm clock!</li>
                    <li>Voice B: You still have that? I told you to throw that thing out.</li>
                    <li>Voice A: I knew it would come in handy some day. Let me turn it on.</li>
