                <p class="flavour-text">A machine that knows no bounds when it comes to ciphers.</p>
                <p>From the <a href="Not%20Kanji.html">Not Kanji</a> module by T-chen/Tepel.</p>
                <p>Create a key using the keyword on screen 1 and the Boolean Expression on screen A. Place a # at the end of the key. This will be called Cube A.</p>
                <p>Create a 2nd key by doing the same steps to create Cube A but with the keyword on screen 2 and the Boolean Expression on screen B. This will be called Cube B.</p>
                <p>Swap the character shown on screen 3 with the #, using the left character for Cube A, and the right character for Cube B.</p>
                <p>
                    Rearrange both keys so that it fills an 3×3×3 cube: The first layer of the cube consists of the first 9 letters filled in 3×3 grid in reading order.
                    The 2nd layer consists of the next 9 letters and the 3rd layer consist of the last 9 letters.
                    The row numbers are counted 1–3 from top to bottom. The column numbers are counted 1–3 from left to right.
                </p>
                <p>Concatenate the encrypted word with the characters on screen C in that order. Then split the encrypted word into groups of 3 characters.</p>
                <p>If the Submit Button is white, follow the instructions under Encrypt Instructions. Otherwise follow the instructions under Decrypt Instructions.</p>
