                <h2>On the Subject of Shashki</h2>
                <p class="flavour-text">This game is very similar to checkers, but the pieces are more powerful.</p>
                <p>The module is an 8×8 checkerboard. There are 12 green and 12 red pieces on this board. The Green pieces are located on the bottom of the module, while red pieces are located on the top.</p>
                <p>You control the green pieces and are the first to move. To solve the module, win 3 times in a row or play a total of 6 times in a draw. After every 15th game, if the module is not solved, then the current win-streak is interrupted, and the counter of draws is reset to zero.</p>
                <p>Defeat will lead to a strike. Trying to make a non-jumping move when capture is possible will result in a forfeit defeat. A win with the opponent’s pieces on the board will result in two wins being credited instead of one. Defeat while you have pieces will result in two defeats instead of one.</p>
                <p>There are two kinds of pieces: "men" and "kings". Kings have a crown on top of it. To make a move select the piece to be moved and press the destination square. If after a jump it is required to make another jump just press destination without selecting the piece.</p>
                <p>If for 3 moves in a row not a single men has been moved, and the number of pieces has not changed, then a draw will be counted.</p>
                <p>You can read the shashki rules on the next page. The rules are different from checkers underlined.</p>

                <h3>Shashki rules:</h3>
                <ul>
                    <li>Men move forward diagonally to an adjacent unoccupied square</li>
                    <li>The row closest to each player is called the "kings row"</li>
                    <li>If a player’s piece moves into the "kings row" on the opposing player’s side of the board, that piece becomes a "king"</li>
                    <li>King has the ability to move backwards as well as forwards</li>
                    <li><u>King can move any number of squares if they all are empty</u></li>
                    <li>If the adjacent square contains an opponent’s piece, and the square immediately beyond it is vacant, the opponent’s piece may be captured by jumping over it</li>
                    <li>Jumping can be done forward <u>and backward</u></li>
                    <li>Multiple-jump moves are possible if, when the jumping piece lands, there is another piece that can be jumped</li>
                    <li>Jumping is mandatory and cannot be passed up to make a non-jumping move</li>
                    <li>When there is more than one way to jump, either can be chosen</li>
                    <li>If after jump piece can make another jump, it has to do it</li>
                    <li><u>King can jump any number of squares if there is only one opponent’s piece is on the way</u></li>
                    <li><u>In the case of multiple-jumps, you cannot jump in the opposite direction to the previous jump</u></li>
                    <li><u>If a man touches the "kings row" during a capture and can continue a capture, it jumps backwards as a king</u></li>
                    <li>A player with no valid move remaining loses. This is the case if the player either has no pieces left or if a player’s pieces are obstructed from making a legal move by the pieces of the opponent</li>
