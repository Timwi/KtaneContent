                <p class="flavour-text">-. . ...- . .-. / ..-. --- .-. --. . -</p>
                <p>Upon each <a href="../More/Ignore%20Table.html#mod=forgetMorseNot">non-ignored module</a> being solved, a Morse code transmission will be received via audio and a
                    flashing light.</p>
                <ul>
                    <li>Transmit "RPT" to hear it again.</li>
                    <li>Transmit "QTQ" to hear future transmissions faster.</li>
                    <li>Transmit "QTS" to hear future transmissions slower.</li>
                </ul>
                <p>If you receive "CQ", immediately reply by transmitting "R".</p>
                <p>If you receive a number, immediately reply by transmitting exactly what was received at that stage.</p>
                <p>If at any point you receive "??", respond with "E" to solve the module immediately.</p>
                <p>In all other cases, you will receive a single letter. If the letter is in the table below,
                    immediately reply by respond to the corresponding question. An affirmative answer is transmitted as
                    "A", and a negative answer is transmitted as "N". Numeric answers are transmitted with numerals.
                    Otherwise, remember the received letter for later.</p>
                <table>
                    <tr>
                        <th>P</th>
                        <td>How many ports are on the bomb?</td>
                        <th>X</th>

                        <th>V</th>
                        <td>Is there a vowel in the serial number?</td>
                        <th>B</th>
                        <td>How many batteries are on the bomb?</td>

                </table>
                <p>When all other non-ignored modules on the bomb have been solved, you will receive "?" (..--..)
                    followed by a
                    number. Transmit the letter remembered at that stage to solve the module. There may be multiple
                    stages asked for.</p>
                <p>To transmit a letter, press the module for all of its dots and dashes in order. Ensure that no more
                    than one second passes between each dot and dash in the letter. For a dot, tap the module for less
                    than half a second. For a dash, hold the module for more than half a second. Between letters, wait
                    for more than a second.</p>
