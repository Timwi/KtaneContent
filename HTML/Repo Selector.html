                    <h2>On the Subject of Repo Selector</h2>
                    <p class="flavour-text">You can't hide anything from me. Yes, I can see your pineapple there!</p>
                    On the module you see:
                    <ul>
                        <li>A display with a question on it</li>
                        <li>Two buttons pointing left and right</li>
                        <li>A submit button (enter)</li>
                        <li>A blinking LED (green or red)</li>
                    </ul>
                    If you don't, you either:
                    <ul>
                        <li>Clicked on the wrong manual :P</li>
                        <li>Have a BSoD covering the module in which case you've disabled repoSelectorService in Mod Selector. Please enable it! But for now, click on the last line to solve the module!</li>
                    </ul>
                    <p>
                        You need to answer 3 questions, and the module will solve. If you get one wrong, the whole module resets.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        Questions can be either one of the followings:
                    </p>
                    <ul>
                        <li>What is the Xth letter/digit of the module that is Yth on the repo sorted by {sorting method}?</li>
                        <li>What is the Xth letter/digit of the module that is loaded Yth in game?</li>
                        <li>Is {module} disabled by an enabled profile?</li>
                        <li>What is the Xth letter/digit of the module that is the Yth one on a list of all disabled modules? (A-Z)</li>
                        <li>What is the Xth letter/digit of the module that is the Yth one on a list of all enabled modules? (A-Z)</li>
                        <li>Is the Xth module on the repo sorted by {sorting method} loaded in the game?</li>
                        <li>Is the Xth module loaded in the game (A-Z) the same module as the Xth module on the repo sorted by {sorting method}?</li>
                        <li>What is the Xth letter/digit of the module that is the Yth one on a list of all disabled modules sorted by {sorting method} on the repo?</li>
                        <li>What is the Xth letter/digit of the module that is the Yth one on a list of all enabled modules sorted by {sorting method} on the repo?</li>
                        <li>What is the Xth letter of/digit the module that is Yth on the bomb sorted {A-Z/Z-A} (Use the name of the modules to sort them here)</li>
                    </ul>
                    <p>
                        <strong>Exclude vanilla modules except for the last question!</strong><br>
                        When you sort the modules on the bomb, use their names (regarding the word "The")
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        <span style="font-style: italic">Note: </span>When you have to get the Xth letter or digit of a module, use the module's name. However if there are no such characters in the module's name, use its ID!<br>
                        Ordering by loaded modules isn't the order that the game loads modules in, it's a list of all enabled and disabled modules sorted by their sort keys (A-Z).

                        You can cycle between answers using the arrow keys, and submit the answer using the enter button (bottom-right corner of the display).

                        <strong>Note:</strong> When sorting the <em>repo</em> (see Mod Selector sorting below), always use the sort keys of the modules (like the repo does) as a secondary sorting method (alphabetical order), unless the sorting method is A-Z or Z-A, in which case use it as the primary sorting method.<br>
                        <span style="font-style: italic">Sort key</span> is the name of the module (except for fake modules) in all caps, without the initial "the" and without spaces.<br>
                        All uploaded module has the same sort key as there are on the repo!

                        Each module that is loaded in the game but isn't present on the repo will have a fake profile with the following information:
