            <p class="flavour-text">But not too much.</p>
            <p>Beat the module in the match-taking game of Nim.</p>
            <h4>How to play</h4>
            <p>In Nim, two players take turns taking as many matches as they want, from a single row. Take the last match to win (normal play, no misère game).</p>
            <p>Click on a row as many times as the number of matches you wish to take. After a couple of seconds thinking time, the module will take a turn.</p>
            <p>When you lose the game, you get a strike and the module resets to a new random configuration.</p>
            <h4>How to win</h4>
            <p>The key to the theory of the game is the binary digital sum, or “bitwise xor”, of the row sizes. This is referred to as the <b>nim-sum</b>, and can be written with this symbol: ⊕. An example of the calculation with rows of size 3, 4, and 5:</p>
            <pre>
             Decimal    Binary
    Row A          3       011
    Row B          4       100
    Row C          5       101 ⊕
             -----------------
                   2       010</pre>
            <p>The nim-sum of rows A, B, and C is 3 ⊕ 4 ⊕ 5 = 2.</p>
            <p>The winning strategy is to finish every move with a nim-sum of 0. This is always possible if the nim-sum is not zero before the move. If the nim-sum <i>is</i> zero, then the next player will lose if the other player does not make a mistake. To find out which move to make, let X be the nim-sum of all the row sizes. For each row, let Y be the nim-sum of X and the row-size. If Y is less than the row-size, the winning strategy is to reduce that row to Y. In the example above, with a nim-sum of X=2:</p>
            <pre>
    A ⊕ X = 3 ⊕ 2 = 1 (Since binary 011 ⊕ 010 = 001)
    B ⊕ X = 4 ⊕ 2 = 6
    C ⊕ X = 5 ⊕ 2 = 7</pre>
            <p>The only row that is reduced is row A, so the winning move is to reduce the size of row A to 1, by removing two matches. More info on <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Nim" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Wikipedia</a>.</p>
