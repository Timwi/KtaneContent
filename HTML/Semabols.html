                <h2>On the Subject of Semabols</h2>
                <p class="flavour-text">I'm not sure what these symbols are, but I'm pretty sure they have something to do with maritime flags.</p>

                <p>The module consists of eight symbols arranged in a regular octagon around six smaller symbols, as well as eight LEDs on the corners of the outer symbols. The LEDs comprise four pairs of LEDs on the same corner, which are ordered in reading order.</p>
                <p>The eight symbols comprise a cross section of a 3&times;3&times;3 cube composed of three of the layers below along the X or Y axis, although the symbols are not in order and the center symbol is missing. All layers of the cube are in the orientation shown.</p>
                <p>Each pair of LEDs correspond to a Semaphore character when their symbols are placed in the correct positions in the cross-section and the layers of the cube are assembled in the proper order. Each symbol in the cube, except the middle center symbol, corresponds to a letter of the alphabet going in reading order within the layers and from top to bottom between the layers.</p>
                <p>There is one way to assemble the layers of the cube such that each Semaphore character indicated by the LEDs has an equivalent symbol in the inner symbols. Press the symbols corresponding to the semaphore characters in order of the LED pairs to solve the module.</p>
                <p>Striking will clear your input, but will not reset the module.</p>
