					<h2>On the Subject of Chess</h2>
					<p class="flavour-text">Under pressure, chess can feel more like a game of battleships.</p>
					<p>This module is based on a <b>6x6 chessboard</b> <i>(referenced on the following page)</i> and all figures follow the standard FIDE movement rules.
					<p>The chess module will present with a display and two rows of six buttons each.
					<ul>
						<li>There are six unique coordinates that represent six positions on the chessboard.</li>
						<li>Use the numbered keys in the bottom row to browse through the different coordinates. A green LED below the button will indicate the position of the currently selected coordinate.</li>
						<li>Using the reference table below, each position can be assigned a certain chess figure.</li>
						<li>The chess figures will cover 35 of the 36 possible fields with their combined movesets.</li>
						<li>All chess figures are colorless but can block each other's movement.</li>
						<li>Find the one field that isn't covered by any of the chess figures and enter the coordinate to defuse the module.</li>
						<li>To enter the coordinate, press the letter first, then the number. The LEDs will turn red to confirm the input of a solution.</li>
					</ul>
					<p>Use this table as reference to determine the correct figure for each position:
					<table class='chess'>
						<tr>
							<td>
								<h4>Position #1: Monarchy vs Theocracy</h4>
								<p>Occupied by a king if Position #5 is occupied by a queen.
								<p>Otherwise, the field is occupied by a bishop.
							</td>
						</tr>
						<tr>
							<td>
								<h4>Position #2: Commander of the Army</h4>
								<p>Occupied by a rook if the last digit of the serial number is odd.
								<p>Otherwise, the field is occupied by a knight.
							</td>
						</tr>
						<tr>
							<td>
								<h4>Position #3: A Matter of Regents</h4>
								<p>Occupied by a queen if there are less than two rooks on the board.
								<p>Otherwise, the field is occupied by a king.
							</td>
						</tr>
						<tr>
							<td>
								<h4>Position #4: The Iron Tower</h4>
								<p>Always occupied by a rook.
							</td>
						</tr>
						<tr>
							<td>
								<h4>Position #5: Conflict between Good and Evil</h4>
								<p>Occupied by a queen if the field is white.
								<p>Otherwise, the field is occupied by a rook.
							</td>
						</tr>
						<tr>
							<td>
								<h4>Position #6: The Scepter, the Sword and the Crosier</h4>
								<p>Occupied by a queen if there are no other queens on the board.
								<p>Otherwise, occupied by a knight if there are no other knights on the board.
								<p>Otherwise, the field is occupied by a bishop.
							</td>
						</tr>
