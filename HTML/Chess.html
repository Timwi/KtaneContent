                <h2>On the Subject of Chess</h2>
                <p class="flavour-text">Under pressure, chess can feel more like a game of battleships.</p>
                <p>This module is based on a <b>6×6 chessboard</b> <i>(referenced on the following page)</i> and all figures follow the standard FIDE movement rules.
                <p>The chess module will present with a display and two rows of six buttons each.
                <ul>
                    <li>There are six unique coordinates that represent six positions on the chessboard.</li>
                    <li>Use the numbered keys in the bottom row to browse through the different coordinates. A green LED below the button will indicate the position of the currently selected coordinate.</li>
                    <li>Using the reference table below, each position can be assigned a certain chess figure.</li>
                    <li>The chess figures will cover 35 of the 36 possible fields with their combined movesets.</li>
                    <li>All chess figures are colorless but can block each other's movement.</li>
                    <li>Find the one field that isn't covered by any of the chess figures and enter the coordinate to defuse the module.</li>
                    <li>To enter the coordinate, press the letter first, then the number. The LEDs will turn red to confirm the input of a solution.</li>
                </ul>
                <p>Use this table as reference to determine the correct figure for each position:</p>
