                    You’ve lived all your life writing however you wanted without giving a second thought to who would be reading what you misspelled. But now, your life depends on your grammar and orthography, and this bomb is <em>very</em> nitpicky. You should of paid more attention in you’re English class.
                </p>

                <p><i>See Appendix: Grammar for more information.</i></p>
                <ul style="margin:4px 0;padding-left:24px;">
                    <li>An English sentence with one <i>italic</i> word or phrase will be displayed on the large LCD display.</li>
                    <li>Your goal is to select the correct word that fills in the blank.</li>
                    <li>If multiple words appear to complete the sentence correctly, remember that this module is a pedantic prescriptivist!</li>
                    <li>There are three rounds. Correctly complete all the sentences to disarm the module.</li>
                    <li>If a mistake is made during the course of the test, the question number will reset to 1.</li>

                <h2>Appendix: Grammar</h2>
                <p class="footnote">for use with the English Test module</p>
                <p>This appendix contains a brief overview of some grammatical distinctions used in the English Test module and Needy English Test module.</p>
                <p>The <strong>subject</strong> is what is doing the action, and the <strong>object</strong> is what is receiving the action. e.g. In “I buy milk.” <em>I</em> is the subject and <em>milk</em> is the object.</p>
