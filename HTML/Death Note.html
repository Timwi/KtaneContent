                <h2>On the Subject of Death Note</h2>

                <p class="smaller">
                    Kira is currently being secretly investigated by the Japanese police force and therefore cannot give justice to the world or he risks being caught. Therefore, he has mailed your
                    defuser, his trusted friend, his death note and interface to make sure that justice can still be served while he gets himself out of suspicion. Your defuser will be the new temporary god of the
                    new world, the new interim Kira.
                </p>
                <p class="smaller">On the interface is a 24-hour clock, a day counter, the death note, two buttons with a phone and newspaper symbol, and three buttons that say “RETURN”, “PASS ON”, and “GO ON”.</p>
                <p class="smaller">
                    The clock lets your defuser keep track of time to delete criminals in the death note. It also restricts certain deletions to be performed at specific hours and minutes, which can be
                    found on page 3 under <strong>Time Restrictions</strong>.
                </p>
                <p class="smaller">The day counter lets your defuser keep track of how many days they have been the interim Kira. Each day starts at 00:00:00 and ends at 23:59:59.</p>
                <p class="smaller">
                    The death note may be opened by clicking the cover, and closed by pressing the top left corner of the left page when the death note is open. Inside the death note on the left page
                    will be different selectable letters and symbols (including an enter key bottom right and a delete key to its left), which your defuser may use to write down and delete the day’s criminals in the
                    format of [Name] [Time of Death (hr:min:sec)] [Cause of Death]. Use the enter key to separate criminal entries. Writing cannot be erased after pressing enter, so write carefully. There are also
                    restrictions to the causes of death, see page 3 under <strong>Cause of Death Restrictions</strong> to view these restrictions.
                </p>
                <p class="smaller">
                    The button with a phone symbol calls the real Kira, which is not safe to do until the 4th day of being Kira since your defuser could risk him getting caught. Once it is safe to do
                    so, your defuser must call Kira everyday to see if there is specific instructions Kira wants your defuser to follow. Remember that Kira does not like to repeat instructions. Kira assumes your
                    defuser knows to listen to the news and delete the correct criminals without given instructions for the first 3 days.
                </p>
                <p class="smaller">
                    The newspaper button plays a snippet of the day’s news possibly telling the names of criminals*. This is where your defuser gets all the information needed to delete the correct
                    criminals for the day using the death note. The defuser can play the snippet as many times as they want.

                    Certain criminals must always be deleted without restriction, the names of these criminals are marked with with a † and any cause of death on page 3 under <strong>All Causes of
                    Death</strong> may be used*. The criminals announced in the news that are not marked must be checked through the rules on this page under <strong>Deletable Under Circumstances</strong> to
                    determine if they are deletable.
                </p>
                <p class="smaller">
                    The three other buttons are action buttons which can only be pressed when the death note is closed. “RETURN” when clicked will mail the death note back to the real Kira, which can
                    only be done if the real Kira says its okay. “PASS ON” when clicked will pass the death note on to another temporary Kira, which can only be done if the real Kira says its okay. “GO ON” when
                    clicked will let your defuser go on with their day and wait until the next day for more Kira work. Make sure that all times written down in the death note are ones that have not already passed
                    today before pressing these buttons.
                </p>
                <p class="smaller">
                    If at any point an instruction is performed incorrectly by your defuser or all deletions have not been performed by the end of the day, they will be punished harshly with a cruel
                    death by either the real Kira or a spy Kira that the real one has set up to monitor your defuser.
