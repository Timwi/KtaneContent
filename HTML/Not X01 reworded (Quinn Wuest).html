                <ul>
                <li>This module consists of a 10-section dartboard with sector value numbering along the edges. Note the north-facing sector of the dartboard is green-tan on this module instead of red-black.</li>
                <li>Select the bullseye to activate the module. Once activated, the module will hide the sector values and flash a sequence of sectors with a pause between repeats. The first stage will have six flashes. The second stage will add three flashes, and the third stage will add another three flashes.</li>
                <li>Each of the ten sectors will have a boolean value, either set to <em>true</em> or <em>false</em>. All the boolean values will initially be set to false. Go through each of the conditions in List A, and for each true condition, toggle the sectors that the condition’s response corresponds to. (If the sector is set to false, make it true. If the sector is set to true, make it false.)
                <ul>
                <li><em>Note:</em> A <em>partial sum</em> in a sequence is the sum of the current number in the sequence and all previous numbers in the sequence. For example, if the sequence is (3, 4, 7), the partial sums are (3, 7 (3 + 4), 14 (3 + 4 + 7)). The <em>final sum</em> is the sum of all the flashes, or the final partial sum.</li>
                <li><em>Tip:</em> For all the conditions in List A except the last, if it is true at any point, it will remain true for all future stages. For the last condition in List A, if it is false at any point, it will remain false for all future stages.</li>
                </ul></li>
                <li>After all the conditions in List A have been checked, the sectors that are set to "true" are considered to be in the <em>base set</em>.</li>
                <li>Next, refer to List B with the base set for that stage. Go through the list from top to bottom, and find the first condition that applies. Submit all the sectors that the condition corresponds to.</li>
                <li>Submitting the correct set of sectors will advance you to the next stage. Submitting the incorrect set of sectors will incur a strike, and redisplay the values of the sectors. Submitting the correct set of sectors three times will disarm the module.</li>
