                <h2>On the Subject of Crazy Hamburger</h2>
                <p class="flavour-text">Velcome to Joker’s kitches!</p>
                <p>
                    Presented is an ingredient for a hamburger. To solve the module, add ingredients to the hamburger until the next ingredient would make it crazy, then eat it. Adding an ingredient
                    that makes your hamburger crazy or eating the hamburger too early will cause a strike and reset the module.
                </p>
                <p>Each ingredient has a condition that, when met, will make the hamburger crazy, if the ingredient is added. These conditions are listed below.</p>
                <ul>
                    <li>
                        <strong>Bread Made in Turkey</strong>: If there are at least two Breads Made in Turkey, and the previous ingredient was not Bread Made in Turkey, and the previous ingredient is
                        the same as the ingredient after the previous Bread Made in Turkey.
                    </li>
                    <li><strong>Cheese from São Paolo From Brazil</strong>: If this is the fourth Cheese from São Paolo From Brazil, so far.</li>
                    <li><strong>Grass of Death</strong>: If the number of ingredients so far is ten or more.</li>
                    <li><strong>Horse Meat</strong>: If the previous Horse Meat is immediately after a Cheese from São Paolo From Brazil or a Grass of Death.</li>
                    <li><strong>Oil From Iraq</strong>: If the number of ingredients so far is four or more, and the ingredient two before this one and the ingredient three before this one are the same.</li>
                    <li><strong>Red Hot Chili Peppers</strong>: If every other type of ingredient has shown up at least once, so far.</li>
