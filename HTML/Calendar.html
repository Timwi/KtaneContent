                    <li>As you scroll through the calendar, you will notice either a single day circled with a red circle or a group of days bracketed off with red brackets.</li>
                    <li>Using your current local date*, the information on the module, and edgework, you must find the specific day in the specific month to then click in order to solve the module. Any clicks on an improper day will cause you to receive a strike.</li>
