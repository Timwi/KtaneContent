                <h2>On the Subject of Terminology</h2>
                <p class="flavour-text">"Terminology" (noun) - The technical or special terms used in a business, art, science, or special subject</p>
                <p><u>Defusing this module requires the expert to have a device that can connect to the World Wide Web.</u></p>
                <ul>
                    <li>This module contains 5 icons of other KTANE modules, and a definition from the Merriam-Webster Dictionary.
                        <ul>
                            <li>Such definition may be slightly paraphrased, but changes minimally from its original word.</li>
                        </ul>
                    </li>
                    <li>Find the word that the displayed definition corresponds to in the Merriam-Webster Dictionary.</li>
                    <li>Exactly one of the displayed modules contains that word in their manual.
                        <ul>
                            <li>Words obviously can have multiple meanings, but there will never be contextual conflicts.</li>
                        </ul>
                    </li>
                    <li>Press the icon of the one module where its manual contains that word.</li>
                    <li>Do this for 3 stages to solve the module.</li>
                </ul>
                <h3>Extra Specifications</h3>
                <ul>
                    <li>This module queries icons from the Repository of Manual Pages. However, if the module fails to retrieve information from the Repository,
                    the module will rely on built-in icons instead.</li>
                    <li>The border and text of the definition are colored based on the part of speech of the word: 
                    red represents nouns, yellow represents verbs, green represents adjectives, and blue represents adverbs.</li>
                    <li>The list of words can be found in Appendix WORDS.</li>
                </ul>
