                <p class="flavour-text">Failure to rotate the card clockwise around the deck before playing it.</p>

                <p>This module presents an ordered deck of cards. Select the one and only invalid card by pressing the fox icon.</p>
                <p>Note that the invalid card will be invalid on the previous card, the card after it will be invalid on it, and the card after will be <strong>valid</strong> on the previous card.</p>
                <p>The first card is always valid.</p>

                <h3>Rules</h3>
                <p>A card is valid if and only if either of the following two conditions apply:</p>
                <ul>
                    <li>It has the same rank as the previous card.</li>
                    <li>It has the same suit as the previously played card, only when either it is a higher rank than the previously played card, or the previously played card is a Jack, Queen, or King.</li>
                </ul>
