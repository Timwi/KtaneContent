                    <p>Two players are playing the classic game of Twister. The two players take turns placing their hands and feet on various colored dots on a mat (shown on the right).</p>
                    <p>The spinner must be spun once for every <a href="../More/Ignore%20Table.html">non-ignored solvable module</a> on the bomb. Every solve will add one spin to the queue, shown in green lights along the top in binary.</p>
                    <p>The spinner can be spun at any time until there are no more spins left in the queue. The queue does not need to be empty before the next solve.</p>
                    <p>Spins that land on a hand or foot on the left indicate a left hand or foot. Spins that land on the right indicate a right hand or foot.</p>
                    <p>On an even stage, including the initial display of the spinner, the first player must place a hand or foot on a dot. On an odd stage, the second player must place a hand or foot on a dot.</p>
                    <p>After every spin for the first player, take the highest up unoccupied dot, and move downwards as many times as the third character of the serial number, skipping over any occupied dots, and wrapping around to the top if necessary.</p>
                    <p>After every spin for the second player, take the highest up unoccupied dot, and move downwards as many times as the sixth character of the serial number, skipping over any occupied dots, and wrapping around to the top if necessary.</p>
                    <p>If the spinner lands on a hand or foot that is already on the mat, remove that hand or foot first, then calculate its new position.</p>
                    <p>After all spins have been completed, the mat will appear. Place all the hands and feet in the correct positions on the mat. The first player is indicated by a pink color, and the second player is indicated by a purple color. Press the small spinner to submit.</p>
                    <p>If you submit the incorrect hand and foot placements, you may enter stage recovery by holding down the spinner over two timer ticks. By doing so,  you return to the spinner and are able to see all past stages. You may not enter stage recovery if you have not struck on the mat placements. To return to the mat, click the small mat icon.</p>
