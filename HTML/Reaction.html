                    <p class="flavour-text">And it gets <strong>faster</strong>.</p>

                    <p>The module has 6 LEDs on top and 6 buttons on the bottom. The objective is simple: <strong><em>Do not let all the lights be on at the same time.</em></strong> Watch out, because <em>less modules remaining makes it go faster,</em> and unlike other needy modules... well... <strong>It doesn't seem to deactivate.</strong></p>

                    <h3>Turning off the lights</h3>
                    <ul>
                        <li>Each module is differently wired, meaning that which button is connected to which LED isn't the same. Thankfully, <em>there are a number of <strong>rectangular white markings</strong> in the middle of the module</em> (note that this number could be 0) which tells us how it was wired, and therefore, which buttons to click.</li>
                        <li>In the table located on the next section, the relationship between the number of markings and the button-to-LED connections are shown. <strong>Buttons and LEDs are counted from <em>left to right.</em> Click a button that is connected to an LED that's on and it'll turn it off</strong>. It is strongly advised not to click the button of an LED that's off.</li>
                    </ul>
