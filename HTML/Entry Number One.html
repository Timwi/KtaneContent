                    <p class="flavour-text">Still not the sequences round...</p>

                    <p>This module presents an array of keys labelled 0-9, an "GO" key and a display screen, which is upside down. When right way up, the display screen will show three eight-digit numbers and a string of zeros above. The display is slightly corrupted, however it should be readable <i>enough</i>. To solve the module, you must enter in the 8-digit number that should replace the zeros. Entering in an incorrect number will cause a strike. <strong><em>Note: When typing in a number, the leftmost digit will be erased and the number will shift left by one.</em></strong></p>

                    <h3>Sequence Rules</h3>
                    
                    <p>To get the next number in the sequence, a constant coefficient is added to the previous number in the sequence. Therefore, to get the previous number in the sequence, simply subtract the coefficient. This coefficient, however, is not given. However, as it is a constant number, it is definitely possible to determine the coefficient using the three next numbers. If a number goes above eight digits, only the last eight digits will be noted on the display screen.</p>
