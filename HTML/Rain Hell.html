                <h2>On the Subject of Rain Hell</h2>
                <p class="flavour-text">The best Geometry Dash level you will ever play.</p>
                    
                <p>This module has a 5x5 grid of buttons on it that are in the shape of raindrops. It also has a button below the grid labeled "Start Rainfall".</p>
            
                <p>Pressing the "Start Rainfall" button will make the module play a sequence of flashing colors on the raindrop buttons to the sound of music. Almost all colors flashed will be shades of blue (see <strong>Possible Blues</strong> below), but when all raindrop buttons flash white it signifies a new set in the sequence. The button cannot be pressed again until the sequence finishes. It is also possible for a raindrop button to flash red, and the raindrop buttons that do flash red can change the next time the sequence is played.</p>
            
                <p>To solve this module, press the raindrop buttons which had at least 2 of the same color flash in a set that did not flash red. There will always be at least one raindrop button that does this. If a correct raindrop button is pressed after the sequence is played at least once, then it will turn green and won’t need to be pressed again. A green raindrop button will still flash its colors in the sequence if it’s played again, but will not turn back to green once the sequence finishes.</p>
            
                <p>If the raindrop buttons are interacted with before the sequence is played at least once or an unnecessary raindrop button is pressed after the sequence is played at least once then a strike will be recorded and the module will not reset.</p>
