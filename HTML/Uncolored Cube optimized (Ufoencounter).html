                <p class="appendix-reference">See <a href="Appendix CLC-DLC.html">Appendix CLC-DLC</a> for identifying Colored Cube variants.</p>
                <p>
                    This module contains a Colored Cube, which can be either (R)ed, (G)reen, (B)lue, (Y)ellow, (M)agenta, (C)yan, (W)hite or Blac(K).
                    The cube is split into two selectable halves: one is located mostly on the cube’s front face (bottom half),
                    and the other is located mostly on the cube’s back face (top half).
                </p>
                <p>
                    We need to win three rounds, but if we win three in a row we are accused of cheating. Therefore, we purposely lose the third round.
                </p>
                <p>
                    Repeat the four step process below in order for four rounds to solve the module:
                </p>
                <h2>Step 1: Info Gathering</h2>
                <p>
                    The cube initially displayed is the opponent’s cube.
                    Two main pieces of information are taken from this: the color and number.
                    Each cube can be colored Red, Green, Blue, Yellow, Magenta, Cyan, White or Black.
                    Cube colors have values 1-8 in the aforementioned order (Red = 1, Green = 2... Black = 8).
                    The number value of the cube is the number on the top left of the front face.
                </p>
                <p>Refer to <var>A</var> as the color value of the opponent’s cube and <var>B</var> as the number value of the opponent’s cube.</p>
                <p>
                    <strong>
                        IF THIS IS THE THIRD ROUND, WRITE DOWN THE COLOR OF THE CUBE FOR EXCEPTIONS SINCE THE OPPONENT’S CUBE WILL WIN.
                        ELSE, IGNORE THIS AND MOVE ON TO STEP 2.
                    </strong>
                </p>

                <h3>Step 2: Determining Your Cube</h3>
                <p>
                    Our goal is to have a higher score than the opponent, which means determining what time to click the cube.
                    <strong>IF THIS IS THE THIRD ROUND WE WANT THE LOWER SCORE INSTEAD</strong>.
                    To get both our opponent’s score and ours, follow the below formula.
                    <var>T</var> is the time you press the face of the cube according to the two seconds digits of the timer.
                    <var>C</var> is the color value of our cube.
                    <var>D</var> is the number value of our cube.

                    The floor function drops all the decimals on a number. For example, floor(2.3) = 2, but floor(2.9) is also 2.
                    <strong>Note that if D is 1&lt; or &gt;10 the module will not accept the input (no strike will be given, though).</strong>
                </p>
                <p>
                    C = (T % 8) + 1
                </p>
                <p>
                    D = floor(T/7) + B
                </p>
                <p>
                    Our Score = (((A-D) % 8)*((B-C) % 10)) % 10 (Where range is between 1-10)
                </p>
                <p>
                    Opponent’s Score = (((C-B) % 8)*((D-A) % 10)) % 10 (Where range is between 1-10)
                </p>
                <p>
                    Before checking which score is greater, check the below exceptions.
                    If an exception applies to only one, the comparison and instead that cube wins.
                    The color to look for the table is the last winning cube. <strong>FOR THE FIRST ROUND IGNORE EXCEPTIONS.</strong>

                <h3>Step 3: Clicking the Cube</h3>
                <p>
                    Once you determine the correct time to click the cube, click the top section of the cube when the last two digits of the timer equal <var>T</var>.
                    Once this is done, the cube should change into a new cube. If not, D &lt; 1 or D &gt; 10, which in this case you need to find a different <var>T</var>.

                <p>
                    With the new cube shown, write down the color of it for future exceptions <strong>EXCEPT FOR THE THIRD ROUND.</strong>
                    In every round except for the third round, click the top face to show you won the round.
                    In the third round click the bottom face to show you lost.
                    DO NOT ATTEMPT TO WIN THREE TIMES IN A ROW OTHERWISE YOU WILL STRIKE AND YOU WILL HAVE TO RESET EVERYTHING.

                <p>
                    Go through steps 1-4 again until the module has been solved.
