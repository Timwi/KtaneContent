                <h2>On the Subject of Moddle</h2>
                <p class="flavour-text">Who needs words when you've got Hexamaze, Big Circle, Switches, Boozleage, ❖, Totally Accurate Minecraft Simulator, ...?</p>

                    <ul>
                        <li>A module will be chosen from the <a href="https://ktane.timwi.de/">Repository of Manual Pages</a>. Enter this module name into Moddle to solve Moddle.</li>
                        <li>Enter modules into Moddle by typing their <a href="https://ktane.timwi.de/HTML/Icon%20Reveal%20interactive%20(Dark).html">Periodic Table Symbol</a> with your keyboard, and then pressing enter.</li>
                        <li>When a module is entered into Moddle, the five squares in the center will show clues.</li>
                        <li>The solution module as well as any modules entered into Moddle must:
                        <ul>
                            <li>Be a solvable module.</li>
                            <!-- Shouldn't be any that don't meet this criteria. Make a repo request if you find one. -->
                            <li>Have a periodic table symbol consisting of 4 or fewer alphanumeric characters.</li>
                            <li>Have a Twitch Plays score.</li>
                        </ul></li>
                        <li>Entering a combination of letters which doesn't exist as a periodic table symbol will cause a strike.</li>
                        <li>Failing to submit the solution module within 8 guesses will reset Moddle and regenerate the solution module.</li>
                        <li>Pressing the up and down arrows will cycle through previous queries.</li>
                        </ul>
                <h3>Clue Information</h3>
                <ul>
                    <li>The first square represents the module author.<ul>
                        <li>Green: The submitted and solution modules both have the same primary author.</li>
                        <li>Yellow: The submitted and solution modules share at least one contributor.</li>
                        <li>Gray: The submitted and solution modules share no contributors.</li>
                        <li>The primary author is the author listed first in the author list.</li>
                        <li>“Contributors” refers to all types of contributors, including hidden ones (such as Maintainer or Modeling). Go to the Options tab and check “All contributors” to list all names.</li>
                    </ul></li>
                    <li>The 2nd–5th squares represent the publishing date, defuser difficulty, expert difficulty, and Twitch Plays score respectively.<ul>
                        <li>Green: The submitted and solution modules have the same value for the field</li>
                        <li>Up arrow: The solution module has a higher/later value in this field than the submitted module.
                        <li>Down arrow: The solution module has a lower/earlier value in this field than the submitted module.</li>
                        <li>In the case of a module with solve-based Twitch Plays score, assume that there are 10 modules on the bomb.</li>
                    </ul></li>
