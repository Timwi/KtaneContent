                <h2>On the Subject of The Number Game</h2>
                <p class="flavour-text">Crunching numbers against an opponent that is impossible to beat.</p>
                <p>
                    You are currently using an interactive machine called <b>“Number Interacting Machine”</b> (how original).
                    The machine is specialized in beating anyone at <b>“The Number Game”</b>.
                    To make the game more interesting, the machine allows you to go first.
                </p>
                <p><b>The rules of the game are the following:</b></p>
                <ul>
                    <li>On your turn, you must pick a number between <b>1 - [MAXIMUM NUMBER]</b>.</li>
                    <li>On the computer’s turn, the computer will also pick between <b>1 - [MAXIMUM NUMBER]</b>.</li>
                    <li>The player who receives <b>0</b> at the end of the game loses.</li>
                </ul>
                <p>The <b><i>top display</i></b> show the <b>maximum number</b> that can be used on the game.</p>
                <p>The <b><i>middle display</i></b> shows the number remaining on the game. The number will be subtracted by the number you and the computer chose during each player’s turn. Pressing the middle display will submit the number you type on the bottom display.</p>
                <p>The <b><i>bottom display</i></b> shows the number you will pick on your turn. Pressing the bottom display will clear the input that you have given.</p>
                <p>
                    During the game, it can suddenly be halted when the machine detects an error, or an immediate loss for you.
                    Look at <b><u>ERROR MEANING</u></b> to determine what went wrong during the game.

                <p><b>ZERO USAGE ERROR:</b> You submitted <b>“0”</b> as a response. This is an invalid response.</p>
                <p><b>MAXIMUM VALUE OVERFLOW:</b> You submitted a number that is larger than the <b>maximum number</b>. This is an invalid response.</p>

                <p>
                    <b>AUTOMATIC LOSS:</b> You submitted a valid number, but the number given will make the machine impossible to beat.
