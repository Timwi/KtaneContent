                <h2>On the Subject of Ill Morse</h2>
                <p class="flavour-text">OH GOD IT’S SPREADING!!!! FIRST LOGIC, NOW Morse CODE!!!!! NOTHING IS SAFE!!!!!</p>
                <p>On an Ill Morse module, you will see a big display, filled with dots and dashes, a smaller display with a 5-letter word on top, a NEXT and SUBMIT button, and 3 buttons with a dot, dash, and a blank space.</p>
                <p>The module will generate an alphabet, where each letter is associated with a new Morse arrangement. The arrangements are not limited to the original Morse code arrangements (ex: Y = . - - . -). To find out the new meaning of each letter of the alphabet, the module gives you a Morse code sequence that is associated with the word at the top. HOWEVER, the positions of the Morse code sequence are swapped, and the position of each arrangement may not correlate with each position of the word.</p>
                <p>You are able to generate as many words as you like using the NEXT button, which will give you a new word and shuffled Morse code sequence.</p>
                <p>To solve the module, begin by pressing the SUBMIT button to enter into the submission phase. The module will display a new word, but the Morse code sequence display will be empty. Using the new arrangements that correlate to each letter, enter the Morse code for the current word on the display.  You do not need to swap the letters to different positions.</p>
                <p>Pressing the SUBMIT button again will submit the word and give you another. Doing this 3 times to ensure you have a strong understanding of the new Morse code will solve the module. Failure to enter the correct Morse code will give you a strike and reset the stages, but not the entire module. The alphabet will remain the same.</p>
                <p><b><u>BE CAREFUL, AS THERE IS NO BACKSPACE BUTTON ON THIS MODULE.</u></b></p>
