                <h2>On the Subject of Remote Detonator</h2>
                <p class="flavour-text">Added 10 No votes on behalf of the people with claimed modules that didn’t vote.</p>

                <p>This remote sits on the same surface as the alarm clock. On it, there are three switches, one of which is stationed to the left of the button, which is also covered by a protective cover.</p>
                <p>The switches have the following functionalities:</p>
                <ul>
                    <li>Top-left: When flipped, enables the user to instantly retry when the bomb detonates.</li>
                    <li>Top-right: When flipped, enables the bomb to instantly detonates upon solve.</li>
                    <li>Bottom-left: When flipped, enables the user to instantly detonate the bomb upon the press of the button to the right of it. Upon interaction of a different switch, this switch instantly deactivates itself.</li>
                </ul>
                <p>Note that the button cannot be pressed if the bottom-left switch is not activated. In addition, lightly tapping the button after activating the switch may not detonate the bomb, but one should not play with fire.</p>
