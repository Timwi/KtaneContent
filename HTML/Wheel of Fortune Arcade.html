                <h2>On the Subject of Wheel of Fortune Arcade</h2>
                <p class="flavour-text">It's time to spin the wheel!</p>

                <p>This module is a recreation of the 2001 Wheel of Fortune arcade game by ICE. It has a wheel with lights around it, a score display, a stop button, and 3 mute buttons.</p>
                <p>To solve the module you must get your current score to be greater than or equal to the target score. The score display will initially be showing the target score, but the display above the score display can be pressed to show your current score. This display will show either 'T' or 'C' depending on which score is currently shown.</p>
                <p>To gain as much points as possible, try to hit the stop button when the blue light is lit. <i>Note that you can only press the stop button when it is lit.</i> Successfully hitting the blue light will cause the wheel to spin, and whatever is landed on will be added to your current score. In case you miss the blue light, some of the lights near the blue light provide a smaller set of points. The point values for these lights are as follows:</p>
                <ul>
                    <li><strong>1-2</strong> lights from blue -> <strong>7</strong> points</li>
                    <li><strong>3-4</strong> lights from blue -> <strong>6</strong> points</li>
                    <li><strong>5-6</strong> lights from blue -> <strong>5</strong> points</li>
                    <li><strong>7-8</strong> lights from blue -> <strong>4</strong> points</li>
                    <li><strong>9-10</strong> lights from blue -> <strong>3</strong> points</li>
                    <li>Any other light -> <strong>0</strong> points</li>
                </ul>
                <p>This module has 3 different types of audio, and each can be muted with the mute buttons. Pressing the 'S' button will mute all SFX, such as dings. Pressing the 'V' button will mute all voices, such as crowd oohs and ahhs. Pressing the 'M' button will mute the music. You can press any of the buttons again to unmute. An 'X' will be placed over the letter on that button to let you know that audio has been muted.</p>
                <p>Have fun!</p>
                <p><strong>NOTE: Since this is an accurate recreation of the game, the module has a chance of rigging you out of a successful blue light hit and moving your light to be 1 off to make it seem like you missed. The chance for this to occur on each hit is around 50%.</strong></p>
