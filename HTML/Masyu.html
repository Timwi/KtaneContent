                <h2>On the Subject of Masyu</h2>
                <p class="flavour-text">Just some dots and lines, really.</p>

                <p>Masyu is a simple, aesthetic logic puzzle played on a grid. Each puzzle contains black and white dots. The objective is to create a single loop that passes through every dot, abiding by the following two rules:</p>
                <ul><li>The loop must turn in a black dot, and it must pass straight through <u><b>both</b></u> of the following cells on each end.</li>
                    <li>The loop must pass straight through a white dot, and it must turn in either <u><b>one or both</b></u> of the following cells on each end.</li></ul>
                <p>Using these two rules and some logic, the puzzle's unique solution can be found.</p>
                <p>To form the loop, click on a segment in the grid. The loop cannot go outside of the grid, so the segments around the edge of the grid cannot be clicked. To remove a created line, click on it a second time.</p>
                <p>Once the final loop is complete, click the black button to submit the solution. If it is incorrect, a strike will be registered, but the module will <u><b>not</u></b> reset.</p>
                <p>To start over, press and hold the white button until all of the lines clear. The circles will <u><b>not</b></u> change, i.e. it is still the same puzzle.</p><br>
                <p><b><u>Reference:</u></b></p>
                <p>Here are some tips and suggestions, for those who are new to this puzzle:
        <ul><li>Avoid guesswork; only place lines when you know that they are correct.</li>
        <li>When stuck, look back at the circles in the puzzle; you should be able to complete many of them using the two rules.</li>
        <li>Since the loop cannot go outside of the grid, circles on the edges of the grid are easiest to solve.</li>
        <li>All ends must connect to other ends; avoid trapping an end on its own!</li>
        <li>Use negations; if forming a line would break a rule, it usually guarantees that another line should be formed instead. For example, if a black circle cannot have a line heading north, then it must have a line heading south.</li>
        <li>Refer to the chart on the next page for visual examples of the rules:</li></ul></p>
