                    On the display will be a random, four-character string comprised of digits, Latin and Greek symbols, and/or Smiley Glyphs. To solve the module, follow the numbered steps below in 
                    order, then input a series of button presses using the 1 - 8 buttons on the module. The steps required to solve the module are as follows:
                </p>
                <ol>
                    <li>Identify your starting position in the flowchart</li>
                    <li>Calculate the number of moves you need to make</li>
                    <li>Perform the calculated number of moves on the flowchart</li>
                    <li>Use the ending location to find and perform your sequence of inputs</li>
                </ol>
                <h3>1. Identifying the Starting Position</h3>
                <p>
                    The flowchart used in this module can be found in Appendix C. It is comprised of 44 unique “cells”, each indexed from 0 to 43. This index is listed in the top right of each cell 
                    and is referred to as the “cell ID”. Each cell also includes an array of colored shapes and segments for true and false results, all of which will be covered in Step 3. Below you
                    will be calculating your “Starting Cell ID”. This will be the index of the cell you'll start on once you begin moving through the flowchart. Simply follow the instructions listed 
                    below and take note of your final result. To identify symbols, their Numeric Values, and equivalent symbols, reference Appendix A.
                </p>
                <ul>
                    <li>If <strong>exactly</strong> 3 symbols on the display are equivalent, Starting Cell ID = # of batteries present on the bomb</li>
                    <li>Otherwise, if any 2 symbols on the display are equivalent, Starting Cell ID = # of ports present on the bomb</li>
                    <li>
                        Otherwise, your Starting Cell ID will be the right-most digit of the sum of all of the Numeric Values of each symbol on the display.

                                <img src="img/Flowchart Madness/Font Characters/Digit (3).png" /> = 3, and

                            <li>16 + 12 + 3 + 24 = 45</li>
                            <li>The right-most digit of 45 is 5, so your Starting Cell ID is 5</li>

                <h3>2. Calculating the number of moves</h3>
                <p>
                    To calculate the number of moves you need to make, take all the characters in the serial number and find all of their Numeric Values using Appendix A. Then, add all of those 
                    values up and modulo it by 44. This is how many moves you'll have to make.
                    <ul>
                        <li><strong>Ex:</strong> Serial# = M50LF6</li>
                        <li>13 + 5 + 10 + 12 + 6 + 6 = 52</li>
                        <li>52 mod 44 = 8</li>
                        <li>Your total number of moves you'll need to make is 8</li>
                    </ul>
                </p>
                <h3>3. Perform the movements on the Flowchart</h3>
                <p>
                    Below is the basic structure of a cell in the flowchart. Each cell has its Cell ID in the top right, numbered 0 - 43 (1). In the middle are colored shapes, which will determine 
                    whether the cell you're currently in is true or false (2). After determining if the cell is true or false, look to the bottom of the cell in the corresponding box (3 and 4). Make 
                    a move to the cell in the flowchart whose Cell ID matches that number. A “move” is considered made once you leave and enter a new cell in the flowchart. When you're ready, 
                    reference Appendix C for the flowchart.

                <h4>Understanding the Shapes</h4>
                <ul>
                    <li>
                        <strong>Circles:</strong> 
                        Circles are true if any displayed Smiley Glyphs are considered “Happy”. Circles are false otherwise. Check Appendix B for determining Smiley Glyph emotions.
                    </li>
                    <li>
                        <strong>Squares:</strong> 
                        Squares are true if the addition of any two displayed symbol's Numeric Values equals a square number. Squares are false otherwise.
                    </li>
                    <li>
                        <strong>Triangles:</strong> 
                        Triangles are true if any displayed Latin characters match a character in any indicator on the bomb. Triangles are false otherwise.
                    </li>
                    <li>
                        <strong>Skulls:</strong> 
                        Skulls are true if the number of strikes on the bomb is greater than 0. Skulls are false otherwise.
                    </li>

                <h4>Understanding the Colors</h4>
                <p>
                    Shapes in each cell will be colored one of the following colors, making it part of that color's Logic Group. For a cell to be considered true, every Logic Group within the cell 
                    must return true. Otherwise, the cell is considered false. Not every Logic Group will be represented within each cell. The rules for each Logic Group are listed below.</p>
                <ul>
                    <li>
                        <strong>Red:</strong> 
                        Every shape colored red must return false for this Logic Group to be considered true.
                    </li>
                    <li>
                        <strong>Blue:</strong> 
                        Every shape colored blue must <strong>either</strong> all be true <strong>or</strong> all be false for this Logic Group to be considered true.
                    </li>
                    <li>
                        <strong>Green:</strong> 
                        Out of every green shape present, <strong>at least</strong> one green shape must be true for this Logic Group to be considered true.
                    </li>
                    <li>
                        <strong>White:</strong> 
                        White shapes are not evaluated as a group, but are instead evaluated as individual shapes. Each White shape is considered its own Logic Group, and its output is whatever the 
                        output is of the shape.
                    </li>
                    <li>
                        <strong>Purple: Do not evaluate any purple shapes.</strong> 
                        Purple shapes indicate that all shapes matching the purple one within the cell will have their true or false states flipped before evaluating their Logic Group state.
                    </li>
                </ul>
                <p>
                    <strong>Ex:</strong> 
                    If two red circles are present in a cell and circles are considered true, the red Logic Group evaluates to false. However, if two red and one purple circle are present and circles 
                    are considered true, the red Logic Group now evaluates to true.
                </p>
                <h3>4. Locate and Perform the Input Rule</h3>
                <p>
                    Begin moving through the flowchart by starting in the cell that matches your previously calculated Starting Cell ID. Your number of moves always starts at 0. Make all of your 
                    required moves and take note of the cell that you landed on at the very end. This is your Final Cell, and its ID is your Final ID. In the chart below, find your Final ID on the 
                    left, and check the accompanying Input Rule. This will give you instructions about what buttons to press and/or when to press them. Once you have your Input Rule, relay the 
                    information to the Defuser for them to solve the module. The module will only solve when the <strong>entire</strong> string of digits is input correctly. If you mess up an input, 
                    you can press the RESET button and try again.

                            acting help, the module will display symbols for maze coordinates: Latin Letter, Digit, and two Greek Letters. These symbolize column, row, and wall configuration 
                            respectively, but they literally mean nothing. Go take a break or something and leave the Defuser to just sit there for a few minutes. Come back and act really unsure and 
                            scared, then tell them to press buttons (<strong>NOT 1</strong>) in sequence until the display turns to a bunch of Smiley Glyphs. Then laugh at them! Any button pressed 
                            after that will solve the module.

                <p>
                    Smiley Glyphs are made through a combination of a set of eyes and a mouth. Based on these features, each Smiley Glyph also has an emotion: Happy or Sad. The emotion can be determined 
                    by calculating <strong>E</strong>, the Smiley Glyphs “Happiness Score”. For each Smiley Glyph, the Happiness Score will start at 0 and will be modified based on the chart below. 
                    Follow the chart from top to bottom, stopping and performing the required action when the Smiley Glyph in question has the accompanying feature.
