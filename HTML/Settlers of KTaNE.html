                <p>
                    The module shows an arrangement of seven hexagonal tiles (hexes), showing a resource.<br>
                    Also on the module are a button with an anchor, a pair of dice, and a display showing your current reserves of each resource.
                </p>
                <p>
                    Each hex around the outside is associated with one character from the serial number, with the first character aligned with the top-right hex and moving clockwise.
                    Take the relevant character (if it’s a letter, add 9 to its numeric position in the alphabet (so A = 10, B = 11, ..., Z = 35)) and convert it to base 6.
                    Add the digits together, plus another 2. To find the number associated with the centre hex, add the number of indicators and ports together, 
                    take the last digit and add 2. If the calculated number equals 7 refer to Table 1. When that number is rolled on the die, the associated resource will be produced by the hex. 
                    For each settlement you have placed adjacent to the hex, you receive one of that resource; for each city, you receive two.
                </p>
                <p>
                    Begin by selecting a position for your free, first settlement. 
                    Next put a road next to it in one of the three directions. Both the settlement and road are free of charge!
                    After that you may roll the dice. Rolling the dice before that will incur a strike. Select any dice to roll them.
                    Collect all resources you can get by selecting the relevant hex BEFORE doing anything else.
                </p>
                <p>
                    Then you may build structures by selecting the appropriate space on the module, spending the resources as detailed in Table 2.
                    If you do not have the necessary resources, you will incur a strike. Roads are located at the edges of each hexes. Settlements and cities are
                    located at the corners of the hexes.
                    New settlements can only be built if a road is connected to it. Additionally, settlements cannot be placed directly aside from another settlement. There must be
                    at least two roads between every settlement.
                    The city can be seen as an upgraded settlement (produces 2 instead of 1 resource) and therefore, can only be placed
                    where a settlement has been built. The city will replace the settlement.
                </p>
                <p>
                    You may trade 3 of one resource for 1 of another by first selecting the resource you want to trade, then pressing the anchor button, 
                    then selecting the resource you want to receive. Any other presses will incur a strike and reset the trade procedure.
                    If the dice roll a 7 and you have more than 7 resources, you must discard half of your resources, rounded down. 
                    Select a resource to discard it. 
                    You win when you reach 5 points which will disarm the module.
