                <h2>On the Subject of Wander</h2>
                <p class="flavour-text">Look at the stars, look how they shine for you...</p>
                <p>This module contains a screen with a colored maze and four arrow buttons. Identify the walls and color of the maze.</p>
                <p>Apply transformations to the maze based on its RGB color components, in the order red, green, blue. (A maze with black walls will appear to be gray.)</p>
                <ul>
                    <li><em>Red:</em> Horizontally flip the maze.</li>
                    <li><em>Green:</em> Vertically flip the maze.</li>
                    <li><em>Blue:</em> Swap the rows and columns of the maze. (For example, A3 becomes C1.)</li>
                </ul>
                <p>After applying the necessary transformations to the maze, press the screen in the middle. The maze will disappear, and a large number will appear on the screen.</p>
                <p>At this point, you will enter “path planning” mode, in which all positions in the maze will be filled in with a star. (These stars are not seen yet.) Moving in any given direction will cause all stars to move in that direction.</p>
                <p>The number on the screen will show how many living stars there are. When a star collides with a wall, it is killed, and the number on the screen will update to show how many stars have survived the movement.</p>
                <p>Move around in such a way that there is only one living star. At this point, a coordinate will appear at the bottom of the screen, representing the goal position. Move the living star to the goal position without colliding with a wall, then press the middle screen to submit.</p>
                <p>Moving around in such a way that all stars die, attempting to submit when there are multiple living stars, or submitting when the single living star is not at the goal position will incur a strike and reset the module.</p>
                <p>Any time you attempt to submit an answer, or cause all stars to die, the screen will play an animation, showing the list of movements you made.</p>
                <p>Upon solving the module, the living star will turn green, and the true orientation of the maze will be revealed.</p>
