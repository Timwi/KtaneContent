                <h2>On the Subject of Floor Lights</h2>
                <p class="flavour-text">Similar to a certain needy, but this one will kill you if you take the spotlight incorrectly.</p>
                <p>The module consists of a 6×6 tile platform which can display 4 different colors on each tile. Each color indicates a different function that can happen on the tile.</p>
                <p>Before the module generates a pattern (at the start of the bomb), the initial toggle of all the tiles is off. After a stage occurs, the platform will show 3 lit tiles with different colors.</p>
                <p>The platform has already generated a pattern internally, but the display will take about 2 seconds to show the pattern generated.</p>
                <p>Based on the color shown on the tile, toggle the states of the lit tile and its surrounding tiles. You will use the toggle state of the previous stage (if there is no previous stage, use the initial toggle state at the start of the bomb) and modify it so you can generate the toggle state for the current stage. Toggle the tiles in reading order. You can locate the function of each color below.</p>

                <p>After solving all <a href="../More/Ignore%20Table.html#mod=FloorLights">non-ignored modules</a>, the platform will toggle off, and the module will now accept input from the defuser. Toggle the tiles on or off so that it will match the last toggle state. Press <b>“Show Time”</b> to submit the answer.</p>
                <p>Giving the module an incorrect input will cause a strike to be issued. Striking on the module reveals the number of correct toggles you have given to the module.</p>

                    <p>If you struck on the module during submission, you are now able to hold the <strong>"Show Time"</strong> button. Holding for at least 2 seconds will change the button to <strong>"Rewind"</strong>.</p>
                    <p>Releasing the button after changing to <strong>"Rewind"</strong> will return you back to the first stage of the module. You can keep pressing <strong>"Rewind"</strong> to move forward to another stage. However, you can not go back to previous stages if you press the <strong>"Rewind"</strong> button. After reaching the last stage, pressing <strong>"Rewind"</strong> will return you to the submission stage. You can only do this once per strike.</p>
