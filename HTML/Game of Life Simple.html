                <h2>On the Subject of Game of Life Simple</h2>
                <p class="flavour-text">Solving this module is a matter of life and death!</p>

                <p>The module will display a grid of squares colored either black or white. To defuse this module, the rules of Conway’s Game of Life (shown below) will need to be applied to the grid once.
                Note that the rules need to be applied to all the squares at the same time for each generation.
                </p>
                <p>
                The state of each square can be toggled by clicking on it.
                </p>
                <p>Entering the correct final configuration by pressing Submit will solve the module. Entering the wrong configuration this way will induce a strike.
                <br>At any time, by pressing Reset, the module will return to its initial state.
                </p>

                <p>
                A square is considered neighbouring if it is adjacent to another square, including diagonally.
