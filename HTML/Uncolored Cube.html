                <h2>On the Subject of Uncolored Cube</h2>
                <p class="flavour-text">Who knew there would even be gambling with cubes?</p>
                <p class="appendix-reference">See Appendix CLC-DLC from <a href="Colored Cube.html">Colored Cube</a> for identifying Colored Cube variants.</p>
                <p>
                    This module contains a Colored Cube, which can be either (R)ed, (G)reen, (B)lue, (Y)ellow, (M)agenta, (C)yan, (W)hite or Blac(K).
                    The cube is split into two selectable halves: one is located mostly on the cube’s front face, and other is located is located mostly on the cube’s back face.
                </p>
                <p>
                    In this module, you will be judging a “card” game called <strong>Colocuber</strong> - the rules of this game can be found in <strong>Appendix COLOCUBER</strong>.
                    Make sure to thoroughly familiarize yourself with the game’s rules.
                </p>
                <p>
                    Additionally, you have agreed with one of the players to make them win by telling them some information they wouldn’t usually know, and in exchange - they will solve this module.
                    Your player’s opponent is an experienced Colocuber player - don’t let them see through your lies!
                </p><br>
                <p>
                    Your player’s opponent always goes first - their played cube will be on the module (the number value of the cube can be seen in the top left corner of the cube’s top face).
                    Your next cube press (the pressed half and the seconds on the timer at the time of the press, called <u>T</u>) will send a message that will determine what cube your player will play:
                </p>
                <ul>
                    <li>
                        Take <u>T</u> modulo 8, then add 1 to obtain <u>C</u>.
                        Your player will play a cube with the color with the value equal to <u>C</u>.
                    </li>
                    <li>
                        Divide <u>T</u> by 7 and drop decimals if needed.
                        If you pressed the front-face half of the cube, negate the result (write it with a “-” sign).
                        If you pressed the back-face half of the cube, keep the result as is (write it with a “+” sign).
                        Finally, add the new result to the opponent’s played cube’s number value to obtain <u>N</u>.
                        Your player will play a cube with the number value equal to <u>N</u>.
                        <ul>
                            <li>
                                If <u>N</u> goes below 1 or above 10, your player will fully ignore your message.
                            </li>
                        </ul>
                    </li>
                </ul>
                <p>
                    After you send your message, the cube that your player played will be on the module.
                    Now you must judge the played round: if your player won, press the back-face half; if the opponent won, press the front-face half.
                    If the players tied, press either half.

                    As stated in the rules, to make your player win the game, you must let them win 3 rounds.
                    If your player’s opponent wins, the module will not strike, and a new game will be started (indicated by a unique sound).
                </p>
                <p>
                    Beware, as your player’s opponent may leave the game (striking the module, after which a new opponent will join in for a new game), suspecting that you and your player are cheating, if they see one of following two conditions apply:

                <ul>
                    <li>Your player wins the game by winning three rounds <strong>in a row</strong> (without any ties inbetween).</li>
                    <li>Your player tries to play a cube that was already played this game (which wouldn’t normally be possible, as the cube “deck” contains each cube exactly once).</li>

                <h2>Appendix COLOCUBER</h2>
                <p>
                    In a Colocuber “deck” there are 80 different colored cubes.
                    Each cube can be colored Red, Green, Blue, Yellow, Magenta, Cyan, White or Black.
                    Cube colors have values 1-8 in the aforementioned order (Red = 1, Green = 2... Black = 8).
                    Each cube also has a number value 1-10.
                </p>
                <p>
                    A Colocuber game is played between two players until one of them wins three rounds.
                </p>
                <p>
                    A round is played out as follows:
                </p>
                <ol>
                    <li>Both players draw any cube from the deck and play it.</li>
                    <li>
                        Next, total cube values are determined for each player:
                        <ul>
                            <li>Subtract the player’s number value from the opponent’s color value, then add 8 to the result until it is in range 1 to 8.</li>
                            <li>Subtract the player’s color value from the opponent’s nunber value, then add 10 to the result until it is in range 1 to 10.</li>
                            <li>Multiply the results obtained from the previous two steps, and subtract 10 from the obtained product until it is in range 1 to 10. The result is the total cube value for the player.</li>
                        </ul>
                    </li>
                    <li>
                        Depending on the discard “deck”’s top cube, some values are prioritized over others. See the table below to determine the prioritized values.
                        <ul>
                            <li>For the first round of the game, the discard “deck” will be empty, with no values being prioritized.</li>
                        </ul>
                    </li>
                    <li>If <strong>exactly one</strong> of the player’s total cube values are prioritized, they win the round.</li>
                    <li>If <strong>neither/both</strong> of the players’ total cube values are prioritized, the player with the higher total cube value wins the round.</li>
                    <li>If the players’ total cube values are equal, they tie - no one wins the round.</li>
                    <li>If one of the players won the round, they put their cube on top of the discard “deck”.</li>
                </ol>
