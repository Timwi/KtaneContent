                <h2>On the Subject of Combination Locks</h2>
                <p class="flavour-text">This looks like a combination lock. I thought I was disarming this bomb, not unlocking it.</p>
                <p class="appendix-reference"><br>
                    See Appendix B for battery identification reference.
                    <br>
                    See Appendix Two Factor for two factor identification reference.
                </p>
                Like a typical combination lock, this requires 3 numbers to unlock. Turn the dial to the right to the first number. Then turn it to the left for the second number. Finally, turn it to the right for the last number. That will unlock it!
                <br>
                If sequential numbers in the code are the same, perform a full revolution back to
                the same number.

                <b><u>How to decode the combination:</u></b>
                <br>
                <br>
                Each number ranges from 0-19. Refer to the table to determine each number. Be
                careful if there are two factor codes present because they change periodically!
