                <p class="flavour-text">Hope you don't like any artists on here! Because Logan is about to make horrible parodies out of them. Oh great...</p>

                <p>The module consists of a jukebox with three lyrics and three vinyl buttons.</p>
                <p>Use the given lyrics to work out which parody has been selected.</p>
                <p>Enter the parody lyrics in the order they appear in the song.</p>
                <p>Certain words may appear in multiple parodies, but all three will only appear in any one song.</p>
                <p>If a word appears more than once in a parody, use the first instance of its usage.</p>
