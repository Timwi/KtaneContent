                <ul>
                    <li>
                        A module of the Gemini Twins, either <em>Castor</em>
                        or <em>Pollux</em>, will contain a go button, 10 numbered
                        buttons, and five screens.
                    </li>
                    <li>
                        The top screens will each display numbers, with the number
                        coming next being the sum (Castor) or the difference (Pollux) of the
                        currently displaying number and a fixed number. This number is specific
                        to each screen, and each screens has a different number.
                    </li>
                    <li>
                        The bottom left screen is a countdown timer, which is yet
                        to be started. Type in 9 digits (which will appear in the top screens)
                        and the tap the GO! button to start the timer. It will always count
                        down over a bomb timer tick. Pressing GO! before typing in 9 digits
                        into the top screens will incur a strike.
                    </li>
                    <li>
                        The goal is, when the timer reaches zero, that all three
                        numbers on the screen have the same value. Successfully doing so will
                        disarm the module. Unsuccessfully doing so will incur a strike and
                        reset the module.
                    </li>
                    <li>
                        To set the numbers, press the numbered buttons at the
                        bottom of the module, or type with the numbers on your keyboard. The
                        cycling sequence of numbers will stop, and your input will appear
                        starting from the right, and shift left upon every input.
                    </li>
                    <li>
                        If you wish to return to the cycling numbers, hold the GO!
                        button for at least one second.
                    </li>
                    <li>
                        <strong><em>Note:</em></strong> If
                        both a <em>Castor</em> and a <em>Pollux</em>
                        appear on the same bomb, they may be linked! Use the screen at the
                        bottom right to determine which modules are linked. Linked modules have
                        the same two-letter code.
                    </li>
                    <li>
                        Two linked modules must solve at the same time.
                        If one's timer expires before the other, and it solves, the other
                        module will strike, reset, and unlink. Otherwise, if it strikes, the
                        other module will reset, not strike, and stay linked.
                    </li>
                    <li>
                        To
                        solve two linked modules, press GO! on the module with more time on the
                        timer, then press GO! on the module with less time when both are
                        displaying the same time. They will sync with each other, and with the
                        bomb timer.
                    </li>
                </ul>
                <h3>Solving method</h3>

                <h4>Pollux</h4>
                <ul>
                    <li>
                        Take the difference of two consecutive numbers on the same
                        screen.
                        That’s the number for that screen. Do the same for the other screens.
                    </li>
                    <li>
                        Multiply each screen's number by the (not started) number
                        on the timer. Modulo 1000. That’s your input for that screen. Repeat
                        for the
                        other screens.
                    </li>
                </ul>
                <h4>Castor</h4>
                <ul>
                    <li>
                        Take the difference of two consecutive numbers on the same
                        screen.
                        That’s the number for that screen. Do the same for the other screens.
                    </li>
                    <li>
                        Multiply each screen's number by the number on the timer.
                        Modulo
                        1000, then subtract 1000. Drop the negative sign. That’s your input
                        for that screen. Repeat for the other screens.
                    </li>
