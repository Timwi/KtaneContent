                <h2>On the Subject of Orientation Cube</h2>

                <p class="flavour-text">If the bomb doesn’t kill us a brain haemorrhage will.</p>

                <p>
                    In order to defuse this part of the bomb you will need good
                    3D orientation skills. A virtual cube needs to be rotated
                    into a specific orientation using the four keys along the bottom.
                    Unfortunately there is no display to indicate the
                    current orientation of the virtual cube so you will have to
                    imagine the state of the cube yourself.
                </p>

                <p>
                    The two keys in the bottom left will yaw the cube clockwise or
                    anti-clockwise, respective to looking at the cube from the top.
                </p>

                <p>
                    The two keys in the bottom right will roll the cube clockwise
                    or anti-clockwise, respective to the virtual observer. The virtual
                    observer’s position is indicated on the module as an eye.
                    <em>NOTE: The virtual observer’s position may change.</em>
                </p>

                <p>
                    For example, if the eye is at the bottom then it is facing the
                    ‘FRONT’ face. Pressing ‘Roll clockwise’ will place the ‘LEFT’
                    face where the ‘TOP’ face is.
                </p>

                <h3>If the serial number on the bomb contains the letter R:</h3>

                <p>
                    Rotate the cube so that the initial left face is in the same
                    position as the initial top face, then press the SET button.
                </p>

                <h3>
                    Otherwise, if the bomb has a lit indicator with the label TRN
                    <strong>OR</strong> it has a lit/unlit indicator with the label CAR:
                </h3>

                <p>
                    Rotate the cube so that the initial bottom face is in the same
                    position as the initial right face, then press the SET button.
                </p>

                <h3>Otherwise, if the bomb has a PS2 port <strong>OR</strong> there have been one or more strikes:</h3>

                <p>
                    Rotate the cube so that the initial bottom face is in the same
                    position as the initial front face and the initial left face
                    is in the same position as the initial bottom face, then press
                    the SET button.
                </p>

                <h3>Otherwise, if the serial number on the bomb contains either the number 7 or 8:</h3>

                <p>
                    Rotate the cube so that the initial right face is in the same position as the
                    initial bottom face and the initial back face is in the same position as the
                    initial front face, then press the SET button.
                </p>

                <h3>
                    Otherwise, if there are more than two batteries on the bomb
                    <strong>OR</strong> the virtual observer’s initial position is facing the initial left face:
                </h3>

                <p>
                    Rotate the cube so that the initial top face is in the same
                    position as the initial bottom face, then press the SET button.
                </p>

                <h3>Otherwise:</h3>

                <p>
                    Rotate the cube so that the initial top face is in the same
                    position as the initial left face, then press the SET button.

                <h3>On a strike:</h3>

                <p>
                    If you get strike then the virtual cube will be reset to the
                    initial position. Be aware you may need to select a new rule
                    if the observer is now in a different position.
