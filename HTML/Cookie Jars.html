                <h2>On the Subject of Cookie Jars</h2>
                <p class="flavour-text">The cookies in this module are practically identical to real cookies, but if you dunk these ones in milk, you’ll explode.</p>

                <p>If your HUNGER bar (at the bottom) ever fills up completely, you'll get a strike. Every time you solve a module, your HUNGER increases. Eat the right cookie to reset your hunger. The module will solve when all cookie jars are empty.</p>

                <p>There are three jars that can be cycled through with the arrows. If you click on the jar, you'll take a cookie from it. However, you can’t eat a cookie if your HUNGER is zero or if there aren’t any cookies in the jar.</p>

                <p>In order to figure out which cookie you need to eat, look at the cookies you ate before. To find the first two cookies eaten, use the first digit of the serial number as the last cookie you've eaten, and the second digit as the second-to-last. The table below has all the types of cookies, their numbers, and the condition that must be true in order to eat them. If none of the cookies can be eaten, eat the cookie with the smallest number.</p>
