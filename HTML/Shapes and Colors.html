                <ul>
                    <li>The current clue will be diaplyed at the top of the module. You can cycle through each clue present on the module using the up/down arrow keys to the right of it.</li>
                    <li>At the bottom of the module is a 3×3 grid that can be filled using the selectors to the right of it.</li>
                    <li>Disarm the module by arranging the 3×3 grid in such a way that it fulfills every condition.</li>
                </ul>
                <h3 class="centered">Rules</h3>
                <ul>
                    <li>Fill the 3×3 grid in such a way that:</li>
                    <li>1: All the clues being presented on the module fits onto the grid.</li>
                    <li>2: Each space is filled with a unique color/shape combination.</li>
                    <li>Pressing one of the values of the selector will select that value. Pressing it again will unselect it. Pressing a different value of the same type will select that value.</li>
                    <li>Pressing one of the spaces will enter the values onto that space you have currently selected.</li>
                    <li>Pressing the space again with a different type will add that value to the space. Pressing it again will remove that value from the space.</li>
                    <li>Pressing a space without any values selected will clear the space.</li>
                    <li>Submitting an unfinished grid will cause the module to strike.</li>
                    <li>Submitting a grid in such a way that a clue that doesn’t fit or has a duplicate color/shape combination will cause the module to strike and generate a new puzzle.</li>

                <ul>
                    <li>A clue must fit onto the grid at least once to fulfill that clue.</li>
                </ul>
                <p class="centered"><img src="img/Shapes and Colors/Clue1.png"> <img src="img/Shapes and Colors/Grid1.png"></p>
                <ul>
                    <li>The clue above tells us that there is a Yellow Triangle in the top left and a Red Circle in center.</li>
                </ul>
                <p class="centered"><img src="img/Shapes and Colors/Clue2.png"> <img src="img/Shapes and Colors/Clue3.png"> <img src="img/Shapes and Colors/Grid2.png"></p>
                <ul>
                    <li>These next clues are partial clues, clues that only give some information. In this case, the Red Diamond is either in the center or the bottom middle while the Yellow Diamond is either in the bottom middle or the bottom right. We know for a fact that the Red Circle has to be in the center so that limits the Red Diamond to the bottom middle. If the Red Diamond has to be in the bottom middle, then the Yellow Diamond has to be in the bottom right.</li>
                </ul>
                <p class="centered"><img src="img/Shapes and Colors/Clue4.png"> <img src="img/Shapes and Colors/Grid3.png"></p>
                <ul>
                    <li>This clue shows us that a Blue Triangle must be in the bottom row. Considering that the grid has 2 out of the 3 spots on the bottom row filled, that leaves one spot left for the Blue Triangle to be placed.</li>
                </ul>

                <ul>
                    <li>This next clue tells us that a Blue Circle has to be to the left of a space that does NOT contain a circle. That means that the Blue Circle can’t be placed in the middle left because the space to the right of it is filled with a Circle, limiting the placement of the Blue Circle to the top middle space.</li>
                </ul>
                <p class="centered"><img src="img/Shapes and Colors/Clue6.png"> <img src="img/Shapes and Colors/Grid5.png"></p>
                <ul>
                    <li>This clue tells us that there has to be a space in the top row that contains the color Red. Considering that the grid has 2 out of the 3 spots on the top row filled, that leaves one spot left for it. Since we placed 2 out of the 3 spaces colored Red, that means that the shape of this color has to be a Triangle.</li>
                </ul>
                <p class="centered"><img src="img/Shapes and Colors/Clue7.png"> <img src="img/Shapes and Colors/Grid6.png"></p>
                <ul>
                    <li>Finally, this clue tells us that there’s a Circle to the right of the color Red. Since we placed all 3 Red shapes, that means the Circle has to be placed in the middle right space. Since this is the 3rd Circle we are placing, the color of this shape has to be Yellow. Through the process of elimination, the middle left space must be filled with a Blue Diamond.</li>
