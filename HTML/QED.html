                <h2>On the Subject of Q.E.D.s</h2>
                <p class="flavour-text">Quaduplets Elusively Detectable</p>
                <p>This module has sixteen cards, each with four features:</p>
                <ol>
                    <li>The card's shape</li>
                    <li>The card's symbol's shape</li>
                    <li>The card's symbol's fill</li>
                    <li>The card's highlighted color and the card's symbol's highlighted color</li>
                </ol>
                <p>A Q.E.D. consists of four elements, where for each feature individually, one of three conditions is
                    true:</p>
                <ol>
                    <li>All four elements are different with respect to the feature.</li>
                    <li>Two pairs of two elements each are identical with respect to the feature.</li>
                    <li>All four elements are identical with respect to the feature.</li>
                </ol>
                <p>A S.E.T. consists of three elements, where for each feature individually, one of two conditions is
                    true:</p>
                <ol>
                    <li>All three elements are different with respect to the feature.</li>
                    <li>All three elements are identical with respect to the feature.</li>
                </ol>
                <p>Locate a S.E.T. of Q.E.D.s of cards. The features of a Q.E.D. consist of which condition is true for
                    each card element. No Q.E.D. can repeat a card already present in a Q.E.D. Select all four cards
                    in one Q.E.D., then all four cards in a second Q.E.D, then all four cards in the the third Q.E.D.
                </p>
                <p>One an entire S.E.T. has been selected, the module will solve. Selecting four cards which do not form
                    a Q.E.D. or three Q.E.D.s which do not form a S.E.T. will result in a strike.</p>
