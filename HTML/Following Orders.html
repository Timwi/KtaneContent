                <h2>On the Subject of Following Orders</h2>
                <p class="flavour-text">This is the first module that wants you to succeed so badly, it’s yelling the answer at you!</p>

                <p><ul>
                    <li>On the module, there is a switch that can turn a speaker on or off.</li>
                    <li>This speaker will relay three to five “shouts” that will tell you directions.</li>
                    <li>There is also a directional pad on the module that will move you from tile to tile on the five by five hieroglyph grid.</li>
                    <li>The hieroglyphs denoting the rows and columns will glow to show you which tile you are currently on.</li>
                    <li>Ten of these twenty-five tiles are trapped, and only one of the tiles will solve the module upon landing on it.</li>
                    <li>The shouts will lead you around the trapped tiles to the exit tile based on the table below.</li>
                    <li>Stepping on a trapped tile will reset all special tiles and randomly generate ten new trapped tiles, and a new exit. The previous trapped tiles will briefly glow red.</li>
                </ul></p>

                <h3>Decoding Shouts:</h3>

                <p><ul>
                    <li>The table on the next page will ask questions regarding the sequence of shouts from the speaker, and your current location.</li>
                    <li>To read this table, first, you will find which row and column have the most criteria present in the shouts you received.</li>
                    <li>You will then move in the direction with the most criteria, to the first space in that direction that has the hieroglyph with the most criteria.</li>
                    <li>Every non-trapped tile will give you a different set of shouts that will always lead you in the correct direction towards the goal,
                        so if you ever take a step in the wrong direction and survive, the new shouts will lead you in the correct direction.</li>
                    <li>In the case of a tie, find the square on which you’re standing on the module and find that same location on the 5 by 5 table below.
                        Use the direction or glyph that cross at that square depending on what’s tied.</li>
                    <li>In this table:
                        <ul>
                            <li>Direction refers to the word being said in each specific instance.</li>
                            <li>Voice refers to one of the three possible people giving directions: a man, a woman, and a child.</li>
                            <li>Shout refers to a specific instance of a voice saying a direction.</li>
                        </ul></li>
                    <li><strong>ONCE IN A BLUE MOON:</strong> Microsoft Sam will just tell you the destination.</li>
