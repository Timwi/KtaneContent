                <p>Press the play button at the top of the module to play four transmissions in Morse code
                    simultaneously. The four transmissions each are a single letter which form a word in the word list
                    below. Pressing the play button will always generate a new word.</p>
                <p>Two of the transmissions will be visual, and two of the transmissions will be audio. Blue LEDs will
                    notate where visual Morse code will appear, and red LEDs will notate where audio Morse code will be
                    played. The pitch of the Morse code is ascending from left to right.</p>
                <p>Determine which word from the word list below that has been transmitted, and press the four buttons
                    in alphabetical order within 20 seconds of pressing the play button. (indicated by the module's
                    timer)</p>
