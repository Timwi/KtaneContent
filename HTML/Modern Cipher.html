                <h2>On the Subject of Modern Cipher</h2>
                <p class="flavour-text">
                    The Roman warlord Caesar had his own personal way to encrypt his data. We could think about him as the father of the modern cryptography. But you are a qualified soldier so you won't have problems in decoding our message, don't you?
                </p>
                <p>
                    You are given an encrypted word. Decrypt it, write it in the second box and press OK to solve the module.<br>
                    To decrypt the word start by finding the key.<br>
                    Add every digit on the serial and then, referring to "Letter-Number Relation" below, follow the cases to find your word.<br>
                    Keep in mind that if you have strikes*, you must add those strikes to the resulting key.
                </p>

                                Every letter of the word must be shifted backwards by the key<br>
                                Keep in mind that if you go under the 0, the next number will be 25
                                because numbers go only from 0 to 25.
                            </td>

                                Every letter of the word must be shifted forwards by the key<br>
                                Keep in mind that if you go over the 25, the next number will be 0
                                because numbers go only from 0 to 25.

                                If this is your first word, refer to Case 01, otherwise go on.<br>
                                Add to the key the number of letters of the last word you decrypted,
                                then proceed as in Case 01.<br>
                                Keep in mind that if you go under the 0, the next number will be 25
                                because numbers go only from 0 to 25.

                                Add to the key the number of solved modules at the moment of the word generation
                                then proceed as in Case 02.<br>
                                Keep in mind that if you go over the 25, the next number will be 0
                                because numbers go only from 0 to 25.
