                <h2>On the Subject of Modules Against Humanity</h2>
                <p class="flavour-text">Some of these modules are really inhumane. What should you do then? Just laugh in their faces.

                <p>This module includes two sets of cards, 10 cards in each set. The first two cards that you see (one black, one white) are
                    referred to as initial cards and they both are considered to be set at number 1. Each card can be set to
                    a number between 1 and 10.

                <h3>To get the secondary cards:</h3>

                <p>If you can spell the word POOP from the letters of one of the initial cards, set that card (or both, if applicable) to number 2.
                <p>Otherwise, the secondary black card’s position is determined by number of unlit indicators + number of ports; and the
                    secondary white card’s position is determined by number of lit indicators + number of batteries.

                <h3>To get the final cards:</h3>

                <p>If only the secondary black card refers to a module that you have on the bomb, adjust the secondary white card by +2.
                <p>If only the secondary white card refers to a module that you have on the bomb, adjust the secondary black card by +1.
                <p>If both secondary cards refer to modules that you have on the bomb, adjust the secondary black card by +4 and the secondary white card by +3.
                <p>If neither of the secondary cards refers to a module that you have on the bomb:
                <ul>
                    <li>If the serial number contains M, A or H, adjust both secondary cards by −2;
                    <li>Otherwise, if the black card is on the left, the final black card’s position is number of distinct port types
                        and the final white card’s position is number of indicators;
                    <li>Otherwise, the final black card’s position is number of modules on the
                        bomb and the final white card remains at the secondary position.
                </ul>

                <p>Once you have the final cards, press the submit button.

                <h3>Notes:</h3>

                <p>Black cards have black background and white letters; white cards have
                    white background and black letters.
                <p>Adjusting by a positive value means cycling the card to the right by the
                    specified number. Adjusting by a negative value means cycling the card
                    to the left by the specified number.
                <p>If the number of a card value is 0, set the card to the number 10. If it is
                    above 10, subtract 10. If it is less than 1, add 10.
                <p>Pressing the reset button will return the module to the initial state.
                <p>Pressing the reset button will not cause a strike.
                <p>Upon a strike, the module will reset itself to the initial state. All the
                    cards on the module will remain the same.
