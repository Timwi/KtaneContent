                    <p class="appendix-reference">Refer to Appendix: Label Priority List for the list of phrases that show up on Labeled Priorities Plus.</p>
                    <p>The module contains 4 selectable displays. This page will go over the gimmicks for this module and its variants.</p>
                    <p>The defuser will need to determine what variant Labeled Priorities is by inspecting what is currently shown on the screens.</p>
                    <p>If the screens:</p>
                    <ul>
                        <li>All display unique phrases from the <strong>The Label Priority List</strong>, the module is Labeled Priorities.</li>
                        <li>All display single digits, the variant is Unlabeled Priorities.</li>
                        <li>All display the exact same phrase from the <strong>The Label Priority List</strong>, the variant is Relabeled Priorities.</li>
                        <li>Have one displaying a 4-digit number and the rest displaying a unique phrase from the <strong>The Label Priority List</strong>, the variant is Mislabeled Priorities.</li>
                    </ul>
                    <p>Alternatively, the defuser can examine where the status light is to determine what Labeled Priorities variant it is. If the status light is on the:</p>
                    <ul>
                        <li>Top-Right: The module is Labeled Priorities.</li>
                        <li>Bottom-Left: The module is Unlabeled Priorities.</li>
                        <li>Top-Left: The module is Relabeled Priorities.</li>
                        <li>Bottom-Right: The module is Mislabeled Priorities.</li>
                    </ul>
                    <p>Once the variant has been determined, the expert will need to go to the respective page and follow the instructions for the provided variant to disarm the module. The variants will contain pages of how a strike is incurred for the given variant. For Labeled and Unlabeled Priorities when the manual references priorities, <strong>The Label Priority List</strong> uses the top-most phrase on page 1 of the appendix as the highest priority and the bottom-most phrase on page 2 of the appendix as the lowest priority.  When the module references positions of the screens, it refers to 1 being the top-most screen, and 4 being the bottom-most screen.</p>

                    <p>If the module is not showing unique phrases on each screen, nor the status light is in the top-right, you may be looking at the wrong module.</p>
                    <p>To disarm the module, examine phrase each screen is displaying with the <strong>The Label Priority List</strong> to determine the order of the screens to press to disarm the module. Press the screen whose phrase is the highest priority, then the 2nd highest, and then the 2nd lowest. Avoid the remaining screen. The number shown after pressing that screen determines when the defuser selected the screen corresponding to the phrase was previously shown.</p>
                    <p>If you press an incorrect screen in order, the module will strike after 3 numbers have been displayed. This may also cause the module to reset with new phrases on the screens.</p>

                    <p>To disarm the module, press a screen to cycle between 4 unique phrases. The screens must be pressed and have the phrases be placed in respect to that number shown before.

                    <p>Use <strong>The Label Priority List</strong> below to determine the priority for each phrase.

                    <p>A strike will incur if the phrases shown conflict with the numbered priority previously shown and cause the module to reset with four new numbers and phrases.</p>

                    <p>This module consists of 4 stages required to disarm the module. Initially, the module will show the exact same phrase for each screen. Remember that phrase shown and press any screen to start disarming the module. Distance in this page will be referred from how many spaces in between the specified phrases in <strong>The Label Priority List</strong>. The list does not wrap around unless otherwise stated.</p>
                    <h4>Stage 1:</h4>
                    <p>All 4 phrases on each screen will be unique and neither of them are exactly the phrase shown initially. Press the screen whose phrase is the closest to the initially shown phrase. If there are multiple phrases closest to the initially shown phrase, either can be pressed. Remember the position of the screen pressed and the pressed screen's phrase on this stage.</p>
                    <h4>Stage 2:</h4>
                    <p>Find any screens whose phrase is furthest from the remembered phrase from stage 1 and position is NOT pressed from stage 1. Press any one of those and remember the position and the phrase of the pressed screen on this stage.</p>
                    <h4>Stage 3:</h4>
                    <p>Starting at the remembered phrase from stage 2, go down <strong>The Label Priority List</strong> until you encounter a phrase on any of the screens, wrapping to the top around if necessary. Press that screen if that screen has not yet been pressed from the previous stages. Otherwise continue until you reach an unpressed screen. Remember phrase and the position of the pressed screen for the next stage.</p>
                    <h4>Stage 4:</h4>
                    <p>The fourth stage will have all remembered phrases from before. From the previous stages, assign the initially remembered phrase the remaining position not pressed. Then in ascending order of the remembered positions, press the screens that have the remembered phrases displayed in that order. Numbers will replace the phrases denoting when you pressed it on this stage.</p>
                    <p class="exempt">Pressing an incorrect screen/sequence will result in a strike and reset all progress to the beginning. This will also display a new phrase for all screens.</p>

                <p>If not exactly one screen displays a 4-digit number and the rest a unique phrase from the <strong>The Label Priority List</strong>, nor the status light is in the bottom-right, you may be looking at the wrong module.</p>
                <p>To disarm the module, start by pressing the 3 displayed phrases in any order. Remember these phrases and the order they were pressed in. Remember the 4-digit number while NOT pressing the screen containing this.</p>
                <p>Incorrectly selecting a screen or pressing the screens in the wrong order will cause a strike and make the module reset with a new 4-digit number and 3 different phrases.</p>
                <h4>Stages 1 - 3:</h4>
                <p>Using the four digit number, pair the first 3 digits to each of the positions of the three phrases pressed. For each stage, use the intersection of these pairs to obtain a letter. This letter corresponds to an instruction that must be done to complete this stage. Note that only 3 screens need to be pressed for those stages.</p>
