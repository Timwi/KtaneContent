                <p class="flavour-text">Nyaaah nyah, nyah NYAH nyaaaaaah</p>

                <p>If the barrier is not in the standard orientation, you are looking at a different Needy Module.</p>
                <p>This needy module features a sad emoji and a play button.</p>
                <p>In order to deactivate the needy, press the play button to play a random baby insult that will make TracksJo-I mean, the emoji cry to sleep.</p>
                <p>The emoji bends time and space, so there is a barrier around the emoji to prevent it from catastrophic disasters.</p>
                <p>If you do not press the play button, the emoji will cry a river taller than the Nile River, and a strike will be given.</p>
                <p>Wait... what do you mean the play button does nothing? Oh God... this can't be.</p>
                <p>The barrier is in a different orientation, that means the emoji is free to run chaos!</p>
                <p>Okay... the good thing is that the chaos is bound within the needy module and the chaos is limited to summoning five alternate reality copies called taunts.</p>
                <p>These taunts increase starting at one every deactivation.</p>
                <p>Press those taunts in any order to deactivate the needy, otherwise a strike will be given and I will run out of ideas for good KTANE mods.</p>
