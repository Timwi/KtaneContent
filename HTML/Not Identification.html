                <h2>On the Subject of Not Identification</h2>
                <p class="flavour-text">“Oh god, not another one.” - Everyone after seeing the module, probably</p>
                <p>The module takes the form of an identification module. This means the module would have a keyboard, a textbox, a display, three unlit LEDs, and a certain logo.</p>
                <p>To solve the module, complete four stages involving different keys on the keyboard.</p>
                <h3>First stage: The Letters</h3>
                <p>
                    Pressing a letter key may not necessarily type out the intended letter.
                    The letter keys take the form of a different keyboard layout, while also being Caesar shifted forward some number of times, despite still being shown in QWERTY format.
                </p>
                <p>
                    Firstly, type the letter key that types out its labelled letter. If there are multiple, type the first eight in reading order.
                    Type these letters in lowercase. If there are none, just skip to the next step.
                </p>
                <p>Next, type in the name of the layout used, all in uppercase.</p>
                <p>
                    Finally, convert the number that's used in Caesar shifting into a letter through their alphabetical position (A = 1, B = 2, ..., Y = 25, Z = 0).
                    If the number of letters so far in the text box is odd, type it in lowercase, otherwise in uppercase.
                </p>
                <p>Press enter to advance to the next stage.</p>
                <h3>Second stage: The Numbers</h3>
                <p>To advance to the next stage, determine a three-digit goal number.</p>
                <p>One of the LEDs should light up in red. The numerical position of this lit LED, counted from bottom to top, subtract 1, is equal to the goal number modulo 3.</p>
                <p>Type out the number keys labelled 0 to 4. The keys type out a certain digit that could make up the goal number.</p>
                <p>Type out the number keys labelled 5 to 9. The keys type out a digit equal to the goal number modulo the label.</p>
                <p>Type this goal number into the text box, then press enter to advance to the next stage.</p>

            </div>
            <div class="page-content">
                <h3>Third stage: The Symbols</h3>
                <p>
                    Some of the LEDs should light up in different colours.
                    Treating unlit LEDs as 0, green LEDs as 1, red LEDs as 2, and blue LEDs as 3, take the sum of each LED's values and set it as the key number.
                </p>
                <p>Type the symbol key (after shifting) that has the key number as label (before shifting). Once again, the symbol keys may not necessarily type out their labelled numbers.</p>
                <p>Take and set the symbol typed out as the key symbol. Type the key that has the key symbol as label once again, shifting if necessary.</p>
                <p>Repeat the above step until you get a code consisting of ten symbols in the text box. Press enter to advance to the next stage.</p>
                <h3>Fourth stage: The Useless Keys</h3>
                <p>Some of the three LEDs should light up in white. From bottom to top, treating lit LEDs as 1 and unlit LEDs as 0, a different key number in binary can be obtained.</p>
                <p>Count the useless keys in reading order across the keyboard a number of times equal to the key number (starting from the first useless key, Tab, as zero), then press the resulting key.</p>
                <p>
                    Next, count the useless keys in reverse reading order across the keyboard a number of times equal to the key number (starting from the last useless key, Right Ctrl, as zero), then press the resulting key.
                    If this key has been pressed, move to the next unpressed useless key instead, in reverse reading order, wrapping around if necessary.
                </p>
                <p>
                    If at any point in the previous two steps, a Ctrl key, Alt key or Win key is pressed, its other duplicate key must be pressed as well before advancing to the next step.
                    However, if the other key is already pressed, press the next unpressed useless key in reading order instead, again wrapping around if necessary.
                </p>
                <p>Press the remaining unpressed useless keys in any order. Make sure each useless key is only pressed once. Press enter to solve the module.</p>

                <h3>Additional Info</h3>
                <p>This module does not take the form of any existing identification module, nor does it work like an identification module. Its design is to merely troll players, so don’t think too hard about it.</p>
                <p>Each set of keys could only be interacted in certain stages. This means pressing a key in an incorrect stage would strike the module.</p>
                <p>The only keys that can be pressed freely at any stage are the backspace key, the spacebar key, the left/right shift keys, and the enter key.</p>
                <p>Additionally, pressing enter would only strike if the answer is incorrect. A strike will not reset the module, nor reset the stage.</p>
                <p>For stage 1, the keyboard layouts can be found in the next page. The QWERTY format would never be used.</p>
                <p>For stage 2, any three-digit number that satisfies all of the given conditions would be accepted as the goal number. Be noted that 0 can never be the first digit of the goal number.</p>
                <p>For stage 3, the number keys on the first row of the keyboard, when shifted, are considered as symbol keys. Be aware that if the keys are not shifted, they stay as number keys.</p>
                <p>For stage 4, there is no indication on what keys you had pressed so far. Hence, you may press the backspace key once to clear all of your inputs. This does not apply to any other stage.</p>
                <p>The useless keys in stage 4 refer to:</p>
                <ul>
                    <li>Tab</li>
                    <li>Caps Lock</li>
                    <li>Left/Right Ctrl Keys</li>
                    <li>Left/Right Alt Keys</li>
                    <li>Left/Right Win Keys</li>
                    <li>Menu</li>
                </ul>
                <p>Also note that upon a strike in stage 4 would clear all your inputs by default.</p>
                <p>The module has keyboard support. This means you can use your own keyboard to type the keys in the module, although the effects would still stay the same. Note that useless keys in your keyboard would never work as long as it's not stage 4.</p>
