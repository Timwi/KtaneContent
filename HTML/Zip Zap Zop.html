                <h2>On the Subject of Zip Zap Zop</h2>
                <p class="flavour-text">Quit pointing fingers!</p>

                <p>This needy features two masks.</p>
                <p>When the needy first activates, the left mask will start the game of Zip Zap Zop.</p>
                <p>The masks will point at each other and you.</p>
                <p>Every time the masks point, they will say either “Zip,” “Zap,” or “Zop.” The left mask will initially say “Zip.”</p>
                <p>The order will always be “Zip,” “Zap,” then “Zop.” “Zip” comes after “Zop.”</p>
                <p>When you have been pointed at, two buttons labeled left and right will appear. You will have a set time amount to press the correct buttons.</p>
                <p>If you wait too long, the needy will strike.</p>
                <p>If the timer has an even amount of minutes remaining, press the button labeled “Left.” Otherwise, press the button labeled “Right.”</p>
                <p>If you press the wrong button, the needy will strike.</p>
                <p>When you press the correct button, three more buttons will appear.</p>
                <p>If you press a button that is not in the order specified in the manual, the needy will strike.</p>
                <p>If you press either “Left” or “Right” buttons while the “Zip,” “Zap,” and “Zop” buttons are present on the needy, the needy will strike.</p>
                <p>To temporarily deactivate the needy, press the correct buttons until the needy’s timer runs out.</p>
                <p>When the needy deactivates, strikes, or solves, the “Left,” “Right,” “Zip,” “Zap,” and “Zop” buttons disappear.</p>
                <p>When the needy reactivates, the game will continue, starting where the module left off.</p>
