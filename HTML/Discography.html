            <h2>On the Subject of Discography</h2>
            <p class="flavour-text">“Yeah, I don't really listen to music...”</p>

            <p>Someone's logged into my Botify account again and started downloading this strange music. There is this
                one song that I really like from this album though. If only I could remember which one...</p>

            <p>I do remember one word*, but it was from a different song. The song I liked was as many songs forwards from the song with that word as the numerical position through the alphabet of the first <strong>letter</strong> in the serial number.
                I've never been a fan of any instrumental songs, and I really don't like bonus tracks or live versions. We can skip those. Also, since the song with this word isn't the one I liked, we can skip it too.</p>

            <p>I remember all of these words from the songs too, but I just need to know which one was in the song I liked. That'll jog my memory.</p>

            <p>I always listen to my albums in a specific order depending on how good they are.</p>
            <ul>
                <li>I don't listen to albums ranked with zero stars. Spam the skip button to go to a new album.</li>
                <li>For albums ranked with one star, I skip every other song then listen to all the skipped ones at the end.</li>
                <li>For albums ranked with two stars, I listen to the songs in pairs from each end of the album so the first and last, then the second and second last, etc.</li>
                <li>For albums ranked with three stars, I listen to the album in reverse.</li>
                <li>For albums ranked with four stars, I listen to the album in order.</li>
                <li>For albums ranked with five stars, I listen to each song twice in order.</li>
                <li>If the album is marked as explicit on the module, I listen to the album in reverse order compared to how I'd usually listen to it.</li>
            </ul>
            <small>I also really like listening to albums on repeat.</small>

            <p>Use the arrows to cycle through a list of words and press the display in the center to submit the correct word.</p>
            <small>*The word from the starting song is the first word on the display.</small>
