                <h2>On the Subject of Blind Maze</h2>
                <p class="flavour-text">Not only do you have to find the exit, you have to find the beginning!</p>
                <p>
                    This module has four buttons labeled N for North, E for East, S for South, and W for West. The defuser must use the keys to navigate a maze they cannot see. Use the following steps to discover your current maze, where you are in the maze, and which side of the maze the exit is on.
                </p>
                <h3>Step 1: Finding the Maze</h3>
                <ul>
                    <li>Take the last digit of the serial number.
                    <li>Add the number of solved modules.
                    <li>If the number is above nine, subtract 10 until it is between 0 and 9.
                    <li>Locate the maze below with the same number as your final result. This is your maze, but it may be rotated.
                </ul>

            <div class="page-content">
                <h3>Step 2: Finding the Rotation</h3>
                <p>
                    Use the first conditional that applies out of the following list to determine what rotation the maze has.
                </p>
                <ul>
                    <li>If there is exactly one D battery and no AA batteries, rotate the maze 90 degrees clockwise.
                    <li>Otherwise, if there are less than 3 unique port types on the bomb, rotate the maze 270 degrees clockwise.
                    <li>Otherwise, if there is a lit IND indicator and there is a vowel in the serial number, rotate the maze 180 degrees.
                    <li>Otherwise, if there are no yellow buttons and at least one red button, rotate the maze 90 degrees counter-clockwise.
                    <li>Otherwise, if there are at least 3 types of maze-based modules on the bomb*, rotate the maze 180 degrees clockwise.
                    <li>Otherwise, if there are two or more red buttons and there is an unlit MSA indicator, rotate the maze 270 degrees counter-clockwise.
                    <li>Otherwise, keep the maze as it is.
                </ul>
                <h3>Step 3: Finding the Starting Location</h3>
                <p>
                    Look at the keys and use Table A and refer to the color of the key and its letter to find the value of each key.
                </p>
                <ul>
                    <li>For X: Add the values of the North and South keys together.
                    <li>For Y: Add the values of the East and West keys together.
                    <li>If the sum is above 5, subtract 5 until the number is between 1 and 5.
                    <li>Note that both X and Y are after rotation, and move left to right and top to bottom respectively. [1,1] is in the top-left corner of the rotated maze, and X is columns, Y is rows.
                </ul>

                    *Registered maze-based modules are: <em>Maze</em>, <em>Morse-A-Maze</em>, <em>3D Maze</em>, <em>Mouse In The Maze</em>, <em>Hexamaze</em>, <em>Blind Maze</em>, and <em>Polyhedral Maze</em>. Two Hexamazes and a 3D Maze would only count as two unique types of maze-based modules for this criterion.
