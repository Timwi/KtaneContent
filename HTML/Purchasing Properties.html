                    <li>
                        Start in section "Property Color."
                        Follow the instructions in the order listed,
                        and determine the color of the property
                        by the first condition that applies to your bomb.
                    </li>
                    <li>
                        Next, refer to the "Property Address" section.
                        Again, follow the instructions in order,
                        choosing the property of the color-set specified in the previous section
                        by the first valid rule in the "Property Address" section.
                    </li>
                    <li>
                        If at any point you are referred to another section,
                        disregard any other information you have previously attained,
                        and purchase the property as specified in the new section.
                    </li>
                </ul>

                    <li>
                        Firstly, if the bomb has a parallel port,
                        you will need to purchase a pink property.
                    </li>
                    <li>
                        Otherwise, if there is a lit NSA or an unlit MSA indicator on the bomb,
                        you should purchase a property from the green color-set.
                    </li>
                    <li>
                        Otherwise, if there is a lit MSA indicator or an unlit NSA indicator,
                        purchase a blue property.
                    </li>
                    <li>
                        Otherwise, if there is only 1 battery on the bomb,
                        you will need to purchase a yellow property.
                    </li>
                    <li>
                        Otherwise, if the bomb has both an RJ-45 port AND a PS2 port,
                        select an orange property for purchase.
                    </li>
                    <li>
                        Otherwise, if there is a CAR indicator on the bomb, lit or unlit,
                        refer to "On the Rails."
                    </li>
                    <li>
                        Otherwise, if there are at least 3 port plates on the bomb,
                        purchase a purple property.
                    </li>
                    <li>
                        Otherwise, if there are an even number of batteries,
                        you will need to purchase a sky blue property.
                    </li>
                    <li>
                        Otherwise, if there are at least 4 AA batteries,
                        select a red property to purchase.
                    </li>
                    <li>
                        If NONE of the above apply,
                        refer to "Utilities."

                        If the bomb has a lit IND indicator,

                    <li>
                        Otherwise, if there is an odd number of batteries,

                    <li>
                        Otherwise, if there is a TRN indicator on the bomb
                            and you have not been instructed to purchase a purple or blue property,
                        purchase the middle property of the set.

                    <li>
                        Lastly, if you have not already been instructed to purchase a pink or a sky colored property,

                    </li>

                    <li>
                        If the number of port plates on the bomb modulo 4 is 1, purchase the Pennsylvania Railroad.

                    <li>
                        Otherwise, if the number of port plates is a multiple of 4, purchase the Reading Railroad.

                    <li>
                        Otherwise, if there are an even number of port plates, purchase the B. & O. Railroad.

                <h3>Utilities</h3>
                <p>
                Prime numbers are very useful for many applications.
                If there are a prime number of batteries, purchase the Water Works utility.
                Otherwise, purchase the Electric Company.
