                <h2>On the Subject of Sorting</h2>
                <p class="flavour-text">What is the point of implementing a sorting algorithm if you are going to do it manually anyway?</p>

                <ul>
                    <li>The module has a screen at the bottom, among 5 buttons each labelled with a 2-digit number.
                    Refer to the algorithm provided by the screen.</li>
                    </br>

                    <li>It's solved by arranging all buttons smallest to largest. (left-to-right)</li>
                    </br>

                    <li><strong>Positions refer to appearances from left to right, ignoring vertical offset.</strong>
                    For example, 1st position classifies as bottom left.</li>
