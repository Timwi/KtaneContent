                <h2>On the Subject of Sorting</h2>
                <p class="flavour-text">What is the point of implementing a sorting algorithm if you are going to do it manually anyway?</p>

                <ul>
                    <li>The module has a screen and 5 buttons. Refer to the algorithm provided by said screen.</li>
                    <br>
                    <li><strong>Positions refer to order from left to right, ignoring vertical offset.</strong>
                    For example, 1st position classifies as bottom left.</li>
                    <br>

                    <li>It solves when all positions go in ascending value, and strikes if a swap defies the algorithm.</li>
                </ul>
