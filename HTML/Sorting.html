                    <p>The module has a screen at the bottom, among 5 buttons each labelled with a 2-digit number above it.
					Refer to the algorithm in the bottom panel and follow its instructions.</p>
					
					<p><strong>The defuser must be aware that positions refer to appearances from left to right, ignoring vertical offset.</strong> 
					For example, 1st position classifies as bottom left.</p>
