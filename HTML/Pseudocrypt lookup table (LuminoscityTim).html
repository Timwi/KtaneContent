                <p>The display shows a sentence from the prologue of “Into the Wild”, the first book in the “Warriors” series by Erin Hunter.</p>
                <p>However, all punctuation has been removed, and every instance of a letter has been replaced with another letter, except for one.</p>
                <p>Identify the sentence that has been encrypted by using the words in the lookup table,
                    and determine which letter has not been replaced with another.</p>
                <p>Note that 4 word lengths are enough to uniquely identify the phrase, <em>with a few exceptions (shown in gray).</em></p>
                <p><em>Note also that some phrases are less than 4 words.</em></p>
                <p>Use the left and right arrows to change the current letter on the submit button.</p>
                <p>Press the submit button to submit that letter. Submitting the incorrect letter will incur a strike, but not reset the module.
