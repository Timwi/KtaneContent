                        <h2>On the Subject of The Button</h2>
                        <p class="flavour-text">You might think that a button telling you to press it is pretty straightforward. That’s the kind of thinking that gets people exploded.</p>
                        <p class="appendix-reference">See Appendix A for indicator identification reference.<br />See Appendix B for battery identification reference.</p>
                        <p>Follow these rules in the order they are listed. Perform the first action that applies:</p>
						<ol>
                            <li>If the button is blue and the button says "Abort", hold the button and refer to "Releasing a Held Button".</li>
                            <li>If there is more than 1 battery on the bomb and the button says "Detonate", press and immediately release the button.</li>
                            <li>If the button is white and there is a lit indicator with label CAR, hold the button and refer to "Releasing a Held Button".</li>
                            <li>If there are more than 2 batteries on the bomb and there is a lit indicator with label FRK, press and immediately release the button.</li>
                            <li>If the button is yellow, hold the button and refer to "Releasing a Held Button".</li>
                            <li>If the button is red and the button says "Hold", press and immediately release the button.</li>
                            <li>If none of the above apply, hold the button and refer to "Releasing a Held Button".</li>
                        </ol>
                        <h3>Releasing a Held Button</h3>
                        <p>If you start holding the button down, a colored strip will light up on the right side of the module. Based on its color you must release the button at a specific point in time:</p>
						<ul>
                            <li><em>Blue strip:</em> release when the countdown timer has a 4 in any position.</li>
                            <li><em>White strip:</em> release when the countdown timer has a 1 in any position.</li>
                            <li><em>Yellow strip:</em> release when the countdown timer has a 5 in any position.</li>
                            <li><em>Any other color strip:</em> release when the countdown timer has a 1 in any position.</li>
                        </ul>
