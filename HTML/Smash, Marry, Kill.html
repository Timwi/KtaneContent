                <h2>On the Subject of Smash, Marry, Kill</h2>
                <p class="flavour-text">It’s smashing with hammers, get your mind out of the gutter.</p>

                <p>Before any <a href="../More/Ignore Table.html#mod=smashmarrykill">non-ignored
                        modules</a> have been solved, this module will randomly select three of the modules present at a
                    time, and have the word “SMASH”, “MARRY” or “KILL” below. Clicking on a module’s name will
                    categorize it
                    as the word at the bottom. After every group of three, three other modules will be selected, and the
                    process repeats. If the number of non-ignored modules modulo 3 is 2, only the categories of “SMASH”
                    and “MARRY” will appear; if it’s 1, the last remaining module can only be categorized
                    as “SMASH”. <b>If any module is solved before categorization is finished, this module will
                        strike.</b> The probability of any given word appearing is based on the number of
                    <i>unsolved</i> modules in each category when categorization is complete.
                </p>
                <p>Once all non-ignored modules have been categorized, this module will display one of the three words
                    at random. At this point, only a module that has been categorized under that word can be solved
                    without this module striking. After all non-ignored modules have been solved, this module will
                    display the word “SOLVE”; at this point, it can be solved by clicking the word.</p>

                <h3>Alongside Organization</h3>
                <p>If Organization is present as well, this module will cooperate with it and display the category
                    corresponding to the module presented on Organization, effectively making this module redundant.
                    If Organization gives a strike, Smash, Marry, Kill will not. <b>Note that the categorization is
                        still required before solving any non-ignored modules.</b>
                </p>

                <h3>Alongside Mystery Module</h3>
                <p>The module hidden by Mystery Module will not appear as a candidate at all, and can be solved without
                    striking Smash, Marry, Kill. If there is more than one of the module hidden by Mystery Module, it
                    will still appear as a candidate, but the last instance to be solved will be ignored by Smash,
                    Marry, Kill.</p>

                <h3>Alongside Other Smash, Marry, Kills</h3>
                <p>All instances of Smash, Marry, Kill will act identically; all input and output of the modules will be
                    synchronized. Only one instance of Smash, Marry, Kill will give a strike if an incorrect module is solved.</p>

                <h3>Alongside Access Codes</h3>
                <p>Until Access Codes is solved, this module will only display its category. If Access Codes gives a strike, Smash, Marry, Kill will not.</p>
