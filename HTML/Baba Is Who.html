                <h2>On the Subject of Baba Is Who?</h2>
                <p class="flavour-text">Hey, I’ve heard of this game.</p>
                <ul>
                    <li>The module consists of a list of rules and the positions of each of the characters.</li>
                    <li>The characters are: BABA, KEKE, ME, ROCK, FLAG, and WALL.</li>
                    <li>The attributes for each of the characters, where each will be one of either YOU, MOVE, DEFEAT, PUSH, WIN, and STOP.</li>
                    <li>The characters will be shuffled in a 3×2 grid.</li>
                    <li>The characters in the grid can be pressed. Press the correct one to solve.</li>
                </ul>

                <h3>Rules</h3>
                <p>Below are rules for the characters, and the attributes. Match up the rules to the attributes to get six different rules by replacing the ellipses with the parts from the other column. For example, BABA is YOU makes the rule, “If the number of batteries is more than four, press the character that is below the character that is DEFEAT”.</p>
                <p>Then, go through the rules in the order that they are on the module, stopping when you reach a rule that applies. The 3×2 grid loops around.</p>
