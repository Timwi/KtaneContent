                <h2>Ripping Out Stacks Of Sticky Notes</h2>
                <p class="flavour-text">A sticky note can be used to memorize anything you can think of. The main note is the fact that it doesn't stick that long.</p>
                <ul>
                    <li>To disarm, determine which job needs to be done first, and click on the related sticky-note.</li>
                    <li>Using the below and the day of the week the bomb was started on, select the first job in the list.</li>
                    <li>Be aware of sticky notes overlapping each other! This can block parts of the sticky note which will make the defuser have to interpret if the note is an actual job note or not.</li>
                </ul>
                <p>All of the notes are obtained from the source code for this module <a href="https://github.com/EggFriedCheese/KTaNE_StickyNotes/">here.</a></p>
                <h3>To Disarm:</h3>
                <p>Select the first job in reading order in the table provided based on the condition specified. For example, if the day of the week is Monday, you would find the table for the Monday/Friday jobs, Tuesday/Thursday jobs for Tuesday, etc.</p>
                <p>Red Herrings are notes that look vary similar to the correct note but will ALWAYS cause a strike if you select them.</p>
