                <h2>On the Subject of Prison Break</h2>
                <p class="flavour-text">Beware the iconic directional laughs...they belong to a dangerous war criminal.</p>

                <p>Hello, █████. This is your first day being employed as a prison security guard officer in here, so please read this manual carefully and attentively.</p>
                <p>Prison breaks, unfortunately, are very common in here, especially with one of the prisoners here, who almost seem to magically disappear every single day.</p>
                <p>This is why, as a prison security officer, your job is to always check her jail cell at all times, by selecting the module. If she isn’t there, sound the alarms immediately. (Well even if you didn’t, others would by default)</p>
                <p>Please read the guide and instructions below beforehand and make sure to be always ready for a capture. We never know when an escape can happen at any point.</p>
                <h3>A guide to catch Prisoner 1201-111</h3>
                <p>Prisoner 1201-111, a war criminal charged with arson, genocide, murder, terrorism, inhumane experiment, felony escape and a lot more crime activities, is sentenced to imprisonment for eternity.</p>
                <p>She is a veteran escapist in maximum security prisons, so we have devised a plan specifically to capture her.. Still, please be aware that you only have <strong>5 minutes</strong> to secure her. (Time starts as soon as you select the module, be careful!)</p>
                <p>Her comically directional laughs, while appear to be quite annoying, actually plays a huge role in this plan - they reveal the actual escape path she’s currently taking.</p>
                <p>The sound receiver device you have, by default, will receive and analyze the laughs, while showing them in the form of directional arrows.</p>
                <p>As you are still new here, you are only given the task to secure one of many escape path of hers. You can count on the others for the rest.</p>

                <h3>Decrypting directional laughs</h3>
                <ul class="a">
                    <li>Each analyzed laugh denotes a direction, either a cardinal direction <strong>(North, East, West, South)</strong> or an ordinal direction <strong>(Northwest, Northeast, Southwest, Southeast)</strong>. This sequence of directions will be shown in the screen, with a longer pause before repeating.</li>
                    <li>When decrypted, this sequence will form a path, seemingly starting from her prison cell to a certain place in the prison. Go to this place (by pressing the arrow buttons) and secure it (by pressing the display).</li>
                    <li>Her path usually composes of eight to twelve cardinal directions. Ordinal directions are to be treated as <strong>a combination of two closest cardinal directions</strong>. For example, southwest denotes that she moves south then west, or west then south, depending on the path.</li>
                    <li>Note that you should <strong>never</strong> remove leading zeroes unless stated otherwise.</li>
                </ul>
                <ul class="a">
                    <li>Firstly, we will modify the serial number. Concatenate each character in the serial number to form a number, with all letters converted to their alphabetic positions (A = 1, B = 2, etc.)</li>
                    <li>Go through each digit from left to right, starting from the second digit. If the digit directly to the left of this one is even, add 5 to this digit, modulo 10. (For example, 12345 would be changed to 12895)</li>
                    <li>Now, from now on:
                    <ul>
                        <li>Two conditions must be satisfied. Let’s call it condition A and condition B.</li>
                        <li>Condition A is the current number of digits must share parity with the number of received directions.</li>
                        <li>Condition B is the current number of digits must be larger than or equal to the number of received directions.</li>
                        <li>If condition A isn’t satisfied, take the sum of the first and last digits of the number, modulo 10, and insert it in the middle of the number string. If this is not possible, insert this number directly to the left of the middle digit instead.</li>
                        <li>If condition B isn’t satisfied, duplicate the whole number string, add 1 to each digit, modulo 10, then append it at the end of the current number string.</li>
                        <li>From here, if any of the conditions are still not satisfied, restart from the step where condition A isn’t satisfied and go down, modifying the number string accordingly if needed.</li>
                    <li>Go to the next step if both conditions are already satisfied.</li>
                    </ul>
                    </li>
                    <li>This number is now the final number. Take the middle n digits from this number, where n is the number of received directions.</li>
                    <li>Pair each direction to each digit, from left to right. For each pair:
                    <ul>
                        <li>If the digit is 5, always keep the current direction.</li>
                        <li>Otherwise, if the digit is prime, reflect the current direction. (North becomes south, etc.)</li>
                        <li>Otherwise, if the digit is a positive perfect square, rotate the current direction by 45 degrees in regards to a current direction.</li>
                        <li>Otherwise, rotate the current direction by 90 degrees in regards to a current direction.</li>
                        <li>The current rotation direction can be either clockwise or counterclockwise.</li>
                        <li>Each time a received direction is rotated, invert the current rotation direction (clockwise becomes counterclockwise and vice versa) for the next modifications.</li>
                        <li>If the prisoner has attempted to escape an even number of times so far, the initial rotation direction (for the first rotation modification) is clockwise. Otherwise, it is counterclockwise.</li>
                    </ul>
                    </li>
                    <li>You should now have the final taken path.</li>
                </ul>

                <p>The two smaller displays below the jail cell show coordinates. The left shows Prisoner 1201-111’s jail cell number, while the right shows your current location (Letter denotes column, number denotes row, top left is A1). An extra copy of the layout of the prison is also printed in the next page, for your convenience.</p>
                <p>When you have finally secured the place correctly, the prisoner will have nowhere to run and would be forced to comply to our orders and back to solitary confinement, and the module will also be disarmed. Otherwise, <strong>wrongly securing the place</strong> or <strong>letting the five-minute timer run out</strong> would give the prisoner a chance to successfully escape prison, and <strong>a big strike will occur</strong>. Luckily enough our forces are strong enough to quickly recapture her back <strong>(which could take about 30 seconds)</strong> into her cell, and once she’s back you can continue your regular check-ups.</p>
                <p>Walking into a wall won’t occur a strike, but you would need some time <strong>(at least 2 seconds)</strong> to regain your senses, so any movement is ceased during this time period. After that you can move normally again.</p>
                <p>I hereby hope you’ll carry out your duty to the fullest. Thank you, and good luck.</p>
