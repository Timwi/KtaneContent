						<li>The module looks similar to Cheap Checkout but some things are different. The currency has changed to cryptocurrency, the display is now interactable showing a hack that was done on a website. There are also 12 price buttons instead of 8 and 2 additional action buttons which are: <strong>Stabilize</strong> and <strong>Patch</strong> </li>
						<li>Clicking on the LCD will begin to cycle through information that will be used in the following tables below. There is a total of 5 hacks that can be cycled using the arrows.</li>
						<li>Taking the information from the hacks, calculate the price of each one <strong>rounding off to three decimal places</strong> and add their sale depended on the day. Then figure out if the customer has enough cryptocurrency to pay for them. If not, click the "Submit" button and they will fix their price.</li>
						<li>After the customer has enough money, calculate the amount of change that needs to be given back. Enter that into the module and click "Submit". If correct, the module will solve, otherwise it will strike and <strong>not</strong> reset the module.</li>
					</ul>
					<p>The next few tables of this manual will explain what each information gathered from each hack will mean. Below is the format of each Hack:</p>

					<img src="img/Cheat Checkout/Wifi_Symbol.svg" class="diagram">
					<p>There is a WiFi signal beside the two buttons below the module. This will tell you the connection of your signal. Your signal is faulty and it keeps dropping connection, so you need to fix it every now and then. The WiFi has 3 different colors depending on the connection strength as well as it's bars.</p>
					<p><strong><span style="color:#46f42f;">Green</span></strong> - The amount of bars at this signal will be three. This indicates that your signal is fine.</p>
					<p><strong><span style="color:#efef15">Yellow</span></strong> - The amount of bars at this signal will be two. This indicates that your connection is going in and out.
