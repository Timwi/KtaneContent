                <h2>On The Subject Of Pocket Planes</h2>
                <p class="flavour-text">Can we pretend that paper planes don't exist?</p>
                <p>This module was interpreted during a livestream on August 28th 2020, by VFlyer. The extracted livestream footage can be found on his Twitch channel.</p>
                <p>The module consists of 3 stages, each consisting of unique actions required to disarm the module.</p><p>The first stage requires the defuser to pick the correct phrase said by one of the three people. The second stage requires the expert to determine the correct plane that must be used. The third stage determines what other items need to be loaded in a specific order for the plane to take off.</p>
                <p>Any invalid selections during any of the stages will result in a strike. The defuser will also NOT be able to revisit any previous stages, so take notes for each stage when advised.</p>

                <h3>Stage 3: Determining the Correct Items</h3>
                <p>Not all items are loaded in at the same time. You will need to determine the order of which items are loaded in first to disarm this module. To determine the first item to check:</p>
                <ol>
                    <li>Take the first character of the serial number. If this is not a number, convert it into its A1Z26 equivalents.</li>
                    <li>Add the last digit of the serial number.</li>
                    <li>Subtract the product of the number of batteries and the number of battery holders.</li>
                    <li>Modulo 4.</li>
                    <li>Add 1 and count that many items from the top to get the first item to check.</li>
                </ol>
                    <p>From the first provided position, going down, wrapping around to the top of the list if necessary, load that given item if there is room for that given item by pressing the Load/Unload button to the right of the current item. The correct plane has the provided limitations.</p>
                <ul>
                    <li>Do not load items that do not correspond to the correct destination.</li>
                    <li><strong>Also,</strong> do not load items that start with the 2nd letter in the serial number.</li>
                </ul>
                <p>Note: For all planes, all cargo must have at least 1 empty cargo slot to be loaded in. Likewise, all passengers must have 1 empty passenger slot to be loaded in.</p>
                <p>Cargo is shown by crates while passengers are show as similar avatars from stage 1.</p>
                <p>Confirm the order and items by pressing the submit button on the bottom-right to, hopefully, disarm the module.</p>
