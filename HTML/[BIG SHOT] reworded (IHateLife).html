                <h2>On the Subject of [BIG SHOT]</h2>
                <p class="flavour-text">Least informative manual ever.</p>
                <p>When unactivated, the module displays, well, whatever <i>that</i> → <br> is.</p>
                <p>Your character is a heart. Use the WASD keys to move.</p>
                <p>The module activates after a random amount of time. When it activates, you are taken to either a minigame, or a deal screen.</p>
                <p>
                    If you are taken to the deal screen, move over a prompt until it turns yellow, and press SPACE to choose the prompt.<br>
                    Only accept deals if they do not require any money from you and does not disadvantage you. Accept the final deal to solve the module.<br>
                    If a deal seems ambiguous (say, 'I have a deal for you'), accept it anyway.
                </p>
                <p>If you are taken to a minigame, survive for an amount of time. There are 2 main obstacles:</p>
                <ul>
                    <li>Hearts: There are grey hearts spinning around the module. Do not touch them.</li>
                    <li><del>Weird flying shit</del>: Avoid them. After a while, they'll despawn and a new one will spawn from a corner.</li>
                </ul>
                <p>Note that multiple obstacles may appear simultaneously.</p>
