                <p class="flavour-text"><s>There is order in order. A color in the colors. Find it, and all will become clear.</s> But then I had an idea. I used F5. You see, F5 gives me a whole new perspective and I was able to see this Bicolored Squares was not what it seems.</p>
                <p class="appendix-reference" id="appendix-reference">See Appendix of <span class="link"><a href="https://ktane.timwi.de/HTML/Colored%20Squares.html">Colored Squares</a></span> for identifying modules in Colored Squares family.</p>
                <ul>
                    <li>When the bomb is at a certain angle, referred to as the reference angle, the squares will change color. If they do not, you are looking at a different module.</li>
                    <li>Pressing the correct square will progress the module and cause that square to light up white. Light all squares white to disarm the module.</li>
                    <li>Look up the color of each square when the bomb is held straight and when it is held at the reference angle.</li>
                    <li>
                        Use the colors of the squares when looking at the module straight on as the column and the colors of the squares when looking at the module at
                        the referred angle as the row to obtain the values of the non-white squares, from the table provided. White squares will always have a value of 0.
                    </li>
                    <li>
                        Take the sum of the resulting numbers obtained. If the sum is not within the range of 1-16, repeatedly subtract 16 until it isn't.
                        Where 1 is the top-left square, that is the square you need to press in reading order. If that square is already white,
                        press the next non-white square in reading order, wrapping around to the top-left if necessary.
                    </li>
                    <li>After each stage, the colors will change, although the reference angle will not until the module strikes.</li>
                </ul>
