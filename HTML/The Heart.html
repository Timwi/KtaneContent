                <h2>On the Subject of The Heart</h2>
                <p class="flavour-text">It's true; bombs can feel emotions too. How exciting is that?</p>
                <ul style="margin: 0.30em">
                    <li>This module presents a beating heart. It pumps blood to the other modules on the bomb.</li>
                    <li>If the heart beats normally, no action needs to be taken.</li>
                    <li><strong>Incurring a strike</strong> on the bomb will cause the heart to stop beating.
                    Additionally, the heart will stop beating when the bomb's timer <strong>differs by exactly a minute or more from the time it was at when the heart last started again</strong>.
                    Lastly, the heart will also stop beating when the bomb's countdown timer reaches <strong>below 1 second</strong>.</li>
                    <li>A stopped heart will gradually lose its color until there is none left. This will take 60 real-time seconds.</li>
                </ul>

                <h3 style="margin: 0.30em">Defibrillation</h3>
                <ul style="margin: 0.30em">
                    <li>When stopped, the heart must be defibrillated by pressing on it once.</li>
                    <li>Defibrillation must occur before the heart becomes fully decolorized.</li>
                    <li>Upon defibrillation, the heart will restart and regain its healthy color.</li>
                    <li>Failure to defibrillate the heart in time will incur a strike on the bomb.</li>
                    <li>Do not defibrillate a beating heart. This will also incur a strike.</li>
                </ul>

                <h3 style="margin: 0.30em">Disarming the module</h3>
                <ul style="margin: 0.30em">
                    <li>Solved modules do not require blood. Therefore, when enough other modules are solved the heart is no longer needed and will disarm itself.</li>
                    <li>The point at which this occurs is <strong>when the amount of times the heart has been defibrillated is greater than or equal to the amount of remaining unsolved modules on the bomb</strong>. keeping track of these factors may be worth it if the bomb contains modules that do something when a module is solved.</li>
                    <li>The module will then <strong>automatically solve the next time the heart stops beating</strong>. Solved hearts no longer require defibrillation.</li>
                    <li>Multiple hearts cannot solve within <strong>2</strong> real-time seconds of one another. If this situation occurs, a heart will simply stop without solving. The solve will then occur on the next stop. This does not apply if the bomb's countdown timer is below 1 second.</li>
                </ul>
                <h3 style="margin: 0.30em">Edge case</h3>
                <ul style="margin: 0.30em">
                    <li>If for whatever reason the bomb's timer <strong>increases</strong> by a multiple amount of seconds while a heart's solve condition is met, <strong>and</strong> it ends up differing by a minute or more from the starting/reference time, the heart will not stop.</li>
                    <li>Instead, a <strong>new reference time is set</strong>: The heart will stop (and solve) when the bomb's timer is a minute (or more) lower than <strong>the time it jumped to.</strong></li>
                    <li>The heart will also still stop upon a strike or imminent explosion.</li>
                </ul>
