                <h2>On the Subject of Meowmorse</h2>
                <p class="flavour-text">&#x1F408; Is there a CAT indicator on the bomb?</p>
                <ul>
                    <li>This module looks like a <a href="/HTML/Metamorse.html">Metamorse</a> module, but the hexagonal button has triangle ears. Pressing the top right button plays a song containing a series of meows of a cat. The song decodes to a message 3 to 6 letters long in Morse code. There are long pauses between letters. Decode the song by following the rules below:</li>
                    <li style="list-style-type: none;"><ul>
                        <li>If there are 2 or less indicators, turn each letter in the serial number into its numeric position in the alphabet (A=1, B=2,..., Z=26) and calculate their total sum. Subtract the number of "M", "E", "0(zero)", and "W" in the serial number from the total, and then modulo it by 3. Go to the 4th step.</li>
                        <li>Otherwise, get the first three indicators in alphabetical order. For each indicator, take the first letter if it is lit and the third letter if it is unlit to make a 3-letter word. If the word is "CAT", set the target-meow to the middle tone and skip to the next section.
                            <li>Turn each letter in the word into its numeric position in the alphabet (A=1, B=2,..., Z=26) and calculate the total sum. Subtract the number of vowels in the serial number from this sum, and then modulo it by 3.</li>
                            <li>If the final number is 0, the target-meow is low tone. If the final number is 1, the target-meow is middle tone. Otherwise, the target-meow is high tone.</li>
                            <li>Press the display to play the sound of a short middle tone meow.</li>
                    </ul></li>
                    <li>For each received meow from the song, use the table below to turn them into a sequence of dots and dashes. Use the column that applies to the pitch of the received meow compared to the target-meow and the row that matches the length of the received meow.</li>
                </ul>

                <ul>
                    <li>The Morse code message obtained decodes to the name of a cat. Find the name in Table C4T5 and get the meow pitch of that cat and the phrase to answer. </li>
                    <li>Convert this phrase into a Morse code sequence of dots and dashes, then convert them into short and long presses based on Table M30W5, with the column comparing the <strong>meow pitch</strong> with the <strong>target-meow</strong>. (Example: if the target-meow is low tone, and the meow pitch is high tone, the "higher" column should be used.)</li>
                    <li>Before entering anything, press the up and down arrows to set the display to the meow pitch. The higher the cat faces, the higher the tone displayed.</li>
                    <li>Press the hexagonal button for input. A press for more than 1 second is considered as a long press. Anything shorter than 1 second is considered as a short press.</li>
                    <li>Press the ear buttons to input the spaces between letters. If the last number of the serial number is even, use right; otherwise, use left. Pressing the wrong ear will strike but not reset the module.</li>
                    <li>Press the top-right button to submit the phrase.</li>
                    <li>To clear input, hold the top-right button until it turns white. <strong>Note that releasing the button before it turns white submits any input performed on the hex, so be careful!</strong></li>
                    <li>Also note that the button acts as a play button as long as there is no current input. When playing, the button turns red, and the triangular ears and the hex buttons are not interactable.</li>
                    <li>If a wrong word is submitted, the module will strike and a new song will be selected. Otherwise, the module will solve.</li>
