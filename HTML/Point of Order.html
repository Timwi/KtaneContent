                <h2>On the Subject of Points of Order</h2>
                <p class="flavour-text">We are playing weird 4-card KTANE Mao. Play begins with me and proceeds in a clockwise direction.</p>

                <ul>
                    <li>Welcome to this game of Mao. You joined at just the right time. We’ve already played five cards in accordance with the current rules of the game.
                    <li>You have four cards on your hand. Once you pick up your cards, you must play a valid card within 5 seconds to defuse the module.
                    <li>Playing a bad card or failing to play a card within 5 seconds will result in a strike. You will also receive four new cards.
                </ul>

                <p>
                    To find out what the current rules of the game are, examine the cards already played and
                    determine which <em>two</em> of the following rules are active and which one is inactive:
                </p>

                <ol>
                    <li>Examine the first and second character
                        of the serial number. Depending on whether each is a letter or a number, the next card’s suit must be one of the following:

                    <li>Take the alphabetic position of the fourth character of the serial number and add/subtract 3 until it’s in the range 3–5. Ranks must alternate between being divisible and not divisible by this number.</li>
                    <li>Take the alphabetic position of the fifth character of the serial number and add/subtract 3 until it’s in the range 0–2. Call this number <var>x</var>. Ranks of consecutive cards must have a difference of <var>x</var> + 2 or <var>x</var> + 3 (with wraparound allowed).</li>
                </ol>

                <p>Ranks are considered to be numbered from 1 (Ace) to 13 (King).</p>

                <p>Only one of the four cards in front of you is valid to play under the two active rules.</p>
