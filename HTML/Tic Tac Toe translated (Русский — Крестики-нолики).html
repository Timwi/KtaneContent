                <h2>О Крестиках-ноликах</h2>
                <p class="flavour-text">Вот она — расплата за все ничьи в крестиках-ноликах!</p>

                <p>Для деактивации модуля все девять кнопок должны быть заполнены крестиками и ноликами.</p>
                <p>На экране под названием “UP NEXT:” показан либо крестик, либо нолик. На клавиатуре отображено несколько цифр от 1 до 9, и некоторые кнопки уже заполнены крестиками и ноликами. После размещения символа кнопки погаснут.</p>
                <p>Числа в таблице на следующей странице обозначают местоположение на клавиатуре, где должен быть размещен каждый из символов.</p>
                <p>Используйте правила, по которым определяется номер начального ряда:</p>
                <ol>
                    <li>Если <span class="condition" id="condition-1">последняя цифра серийного номера чётна</span>, номер начального ряда лежит между 5 и 9.  Иначе число начального ряда лежит между 1 и 4.</li>
                    <li>Если <span class="condition" id="condition-2">на бомбе имеется хотя бы один параллельный порт</span>, воспользуйтесь чётными числами. Иначе — нечётными.</li>
                    <li>Если <span class="condition" id="condition-3a">негорящих индикаторов больше, чем горящих</span>, номер начального ряда — наименьшее из оставшихся значений после второго правила.</li>
                    <li>Если <span class="condition" id="condition-3b">горящих индикаторов больше, чем негорящих</span>, номер начального ряда — наибольшее из оставшихся значений после второго правила.</li>
                    <li>Если <span class="condition" id="condition-3c">число горящих индикаторов равно числу негорящих</span>, номер начального ряда — среднее арифметическое оставшихся значений после второго правила.</li>
                </ol>

                <p>
                   В таблице определите подходящий столбец, исходя из количества крестиков и ноликов, которые уже присутствуют на модуле. Начните с начального ряда и двигайтесь вниз по выбранному столбцу, пока не дойдете до числа, которое соответствует незаполненной клетке на клавиатуре. Если вы прошли через 9 ряд, продолжайте с 1 ряда.
                </p>

                <p>
                    Если знак на этом месте приведет к победе одной из сторон, вы ОБЯЗАНЫ нажать “PASS” и продолжить с <u>того же</u> ряда. Иначе разместите знак на клавиатуре и переместитесь на <u>следующий</u> ряд в таблице.
                </p>

                <p>
                    Два пропуска подряд приведут к тому, что знак поставится автоматически на одно из свободных мест. Может произойти победа одной из сторон, однако при этом ошибка не будет зафиксирована. В таком случае переместитесь на <u>следующий</u> ряд в таблице.
                </p>

                <p>
                    При получении ошибки ряд обнулится к начальному, и клавиатура отобразит расставленные знаки и оставшиеся числа. Все предыдущие размещения останутся до тех пор, пока модуль не будет деактивирован.
