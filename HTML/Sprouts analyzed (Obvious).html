                    <h2>On the Subject of Trivialising Sprouts</h2>
                    <p class="flavour-text">Well... the math has been done but reading these is another challenge</p>
                    <p>
                        This module displays three dots, and two buttons on the right. The triangular button will select a different line.
                        The circular button will submit the currently shown line.
                        The selected line will always be displayed in grey. To solve the module, win a game of sprouts against the bot.
                    </p>
                    <h3>Game rules</h3>
                    <ul>
                        <li>Players take turns connecting a dot to another dot or itself using a line.</li>
                        <li>A line may bend, but it may not cross any other line or itself.</li>
                        <li>After drawing a line, a new dot must be placed on this newly drawn line.</li>
                        <li>Each dot can have at most three lines connecting it.</li>
                        <li>The player who can no longer play a legal move has lost.</li>
                    </ul>
                    <p>Upon losing, this module will not strike, however it takes a while to load and calculate moves, so try to avoid a time scramble.</p>
                    <p>
                        The following graph indicates the path you should follow on the even positioned columns for each case on the odd positioned column to the left of it.
                        Entering a case that has no continuation noted down implies a forced win regardless of your move or your opponent’s.
                        The star in the top-right area implies the application of an inversion: anything inside and outside a loop can be swapped while keeping the same connective properties.
                        Note that the graph does not show any inverted variants of any of its items.
