                <p>This module consists of 6 coloured keys, each of which is labelled with a coloured number, and a display that shows a counter.</p>
                <p>The possible colours for both the keys and the numbers labelling them are: (R)ed, (G)reen, (B)lue, (C)yan, (M)agenta, and (Y)ellow.</p>
                <p>Any of the numbers 1 - 6 may appear on each of the keys.</p>
                <p>When a module is solved, the counter will decrease and a new set of keys will be generated.</p>
                <p>Once the counter reaches zero, a set consisting of previously generated keys will appear. These keys can now be pressed.</p>
                <p>Press these keys in order of the positions they were originally in to disarm this module.</p>
                <p>Pressing the keys in the wrong order will cause a strike to be issued and generate a new set of keys to be pressed.<br>The correct order will not change.</p>
                <p><strong>Note:</strong> If a key is generated that is identical to a previously generated key before the counter reaches zero, the new key overwrites the previous one.<br>
                      If two or more identical keys are generated in the same set, the rightmost key overwrites the others.</p>
