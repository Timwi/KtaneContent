                <p class="appendix-reference" id="appendix-reference">See Appendix in <a href="Ordered Keys.html">Ordered Keys</a> for identifying modules in Ordered Keys family.</p>

                <p>This module consists of 6 coloured keys, each of which is labelled with a coloured number, and a display that shows a counter.</p>
                <p>The possible colours for both the keys and the numbers labelling them are: (R)ed, (G)reen, (B)lue, (C)yan, (M)agenta, and (Y)ellow.</p>
                <p>Any of the numbers 1 - 6 may appear on each of the keys.</p>
                <p>When a <a href="../More/Ignore Table.html#mod=tallorderedKeys">non-ignored module</a> is solved, the counter will decrease and a new set of keys will be generated.</p>
                <p>Once the counter reaches zero, a set consisting of previously generated keys will appear. These keys can now be pressed.</p>
                <p>Press these keys in order of the positions they were originally in to disarm this module.</p>
                <p>Pressing the keys in the wrong order will cause a strike to be issued. After a strike the module will enter recovery mode where any of the generated sets of keys can be viewed, starting with the first set. Pressing the keys in order from left to right in this mode will change the counter by: +100, +10, +1, -1, -10, and -100. Making the counter reach zero again will put the module back into submission mode where a new set of keys to be pressed will be generated.<br>The correct order to press the keys in will not change.</p>
                <p><strong>Note:</strong> If a key is generated that is identical to a previously generated key before the counter reaches zero, the new key overwrites the previous one.<br>
                      If two or more identical keys are generated in the same set, the rightmost key overwrites the others.</p>
