                <h2>On the Subject of The Alteran Trail</h2>
                <p class="flavour-text">It's 2041, and apparently, whatever your math teacher taught you, will save your life? I don't get it, even if you are on another planet.</p>
                <ul>
                <li>It's the year 2041, and you need to deliver supplies to base.</li>
                <li>There are five buttons that will help guide the way to base.</li>
                <li>These buttons are: Fast, Normal, Slow, Rest, and Heal.</li>
                <li>The Fast Button shows when the power is greater than or equal to 35 mAH.</li>
                <li>The Normal Button shows when the power is greater than or equal to 15 mAH.</li>
                <li>The Slow Button shows when the power is greater than or equal to 10 mAH.</li>
                <li>The Rest Button shows when the power is less than 100 mAH.</li>
                <li>The Rest Button will allow access to the battery charging station.</li>
                <li>To charge the battery, input the correct answer to a simple two-step algebra equation, then press the button that says "Sub".</li>
                <li>The Heal Button shows when your health is less than 100.</li>
                <li>The Heal Button can ONLY be used once, and there is no equation to solve. Use it wisely.</li>
                <li>Every 50km traveled, the jeep will move to a different position along the trail.</li>
                <li>Be wary of the twelve different events that can take place after Day 1. Only one event can happen at a time.</li>
                <li>To solve the module, reach 1000+ km.</li>
                <li>When resting, if you the math equation is wrong, you will strike.</li>
                <li>If you make a mistake inputting your answer, press the battery's conveniently placed clear button to clear your input.</li>

                <h2>On the Subject of The Alteran Trail's Events</h2>
                <p class="flavour-text">Events only those found on the planet of Altera that would kill someone on Earth.</p>
                <ul>
                <li>Here is the list regarding the twelve events and what they do.</li>
                <li>Cloudy - The sun will go dark, and less power will be given to the battery if you choose to charge during this event.</li>
                <li>Sunny - The sun will go bright, and more power will be given to the battery if you choose to charge during this event.</li>
                <li>Alteran Flu - A disease will bring plague across Altera, dealing 10 damage.</li>
                <li>Battery Explosion - Your battery will lose power all of the sudden, exactly 25 mAH will be removed.</li>
                <li>Food Cache - A food cache will appear around your location, supplying 20kg of food.</li>
                <li>Food Locker Breach - Some of your food left the locker. You lost 25kg of food.</li>
                <li>Sandstorm - A sandstorm covers Altera and deals 15 damage.</li>
                <li>Meteor Shower - Meteors land on Altera. Meteors will make a booming sound, and deals 2 damage per meteor and 2 mAH will be lost per meteor. Only five meteors will land.</li>
                <li>Alteran Wolf - A vicious delicacy will cover your bird's eye view of Altera. The wolf deals 15 damage, but you gain 10kg of food.</li>
                <li>Acromantula - A vicious beast of what you call a spider will cover your bird's eye view of Altera and will bite you. You lose health overtime, 15 health total.</li>
                <li>Bandits - Alteran Bandits starts to shoot at your jeep. Each bullet they shoot will deal 1 damage, but they shoot a total of 15 times.</li>
                <li>Normal - Nothing special happens. Nothing bad, but nothing good.</li>
                </ul>

                <h2>On the Subject of Charging the Battery</h2>
                <p class="flavour-text">Quick, how do you calculate the resistance of a lithium car battery?.</p>
                <ul>
                <li>Here is the list of possible equations and how to solve them. (Examples are in parenthesis.)</li>
                <li>One-Step - Simple equations that uses one of the four basic operators to solve. (Example: 3x = 6. Divide Both sides by 3. x = 2)</li>
                <li>Two-Step - Simple equations that uses two of the four basic operators to solve. (Example: 3x + 8 = 20. Subtract both sides by 8. 3x = 12. Divide both sides by 3. x = 2)</li>
                <li>nth Power - Equations that uses nth root to solve. (Example: x to the 3rd power = 64. Take the 3rd root of both sides. x = 4)</li>
                <li>nth Root - Equations that uses nth power to solve. (Example: x to the 3rd root = 4. Take the 3rd power of both sides. x = 64)</li>
                <li>Exponential - Equations that uses log of the coefficient to solve. (Example: 3 to the x power = 81. Make this a logarithmic equation. log of 81 base 3 = x. Take the log(81) and divide by the log(3). x = 4)</li>
                <li>Logarithmic - Equations that deals with logarithms. (Example: log of 64 base 8 = x. Take the log(64) and divide by the log(8). x = 2)</li>
