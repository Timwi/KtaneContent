                <h2>On the Subject of The Alteran Trail</h2>
                <p class="flavour-text">It’s 2041, and apparently, whatever your math teacher taught you, will save your life? I don’t get it, even if you are on another planet.</p>
                <ul>
                <li>It’s the year 2041, and you need to deliver supplies to base.</li>
                <li>There are five buttons that will help guide the way to base.</li>
                <li>These buttons are: Fast, Normal, Slow, Rest, and Heal.</li>
                <li>The Fast Button shows when the power is greater than or equal to 35 mAH.</li>
                <li>The Normal Button shows when the power is greater than or equal to 15 mAH.</li>
                <li>The Slow Button shows when the power is greater than or equal to 10 mAH.</li>
                <li>The Rest Button shows when the power is less than 100 mAH.</li>
                <li>The Rest Button will allow access to the battery charging station.</li>
                <li>To charge the battery, input the correct answer to a simple two-step algebra equation, then press the button that says "Sub".</li>
                <li>The Heal Button shows when your health is less than 100.</li>
                <li>The Heal Button can ONLY be used once, and there is no equation to solve. Use it wisely.</li>
                <li>Every 50km traveled, the jeep will move to a different position along the trail.</li>
                <li>Be wary of the twelve different events that can take place after Day 1. Only one event can happen at a time.</li>
                <li>To solve the module, reach 1000+ km.</li>
                <li>When resting, if you answer the math equation is wrong, you will strike.</li>
                </ul>
