                <h2>On the Subject of Set Connections</h2>
                <p class="flavour-text">Not to be confused with S.E.T. in four dimensions, although this is S.E.T. in four dimensions.</p>

                <p>This module contains a 3×3×3×3 S.E.T. puzzle. Each card will show an image with 4 varying traits: shape, fill, color, and number. No cards are repeated in the puzzle.</p>
                <p>
                    To solve the module, solve the S.E.T. puzzle by selecting your desired traits, then pressing the card you want to have that trait.
                    The module will solve once 54 cards (two thirds) of the puzzle are completed.
                </p>
                <p>For any solved S.E.T. puzzle, each 3×3 group has to have a unique set on each row, column, and diagonal. 3×3 groups wrap around on themselves.</p>
                <p>Additionally, all directions from a point that moves across ranks and/or stacks have to make a unique set.</p>
                <p>
                    When moving across ranks and stacks, represented as rows and columns of 3×3 boards, you can move orthogonally or diagonally to another 3×3 group,
                    in which you will be in the same position in the group before you moved in the group you’re currently in.
                    From there, you can either move in another direction in the 3×3 group with wrap-around, or choose to stay in the same location.
                    Afterwards, you repeat the directions you went in. The 3 cards you pass must make a unique set.
                </p>
                <p>To input cards, select the traits you want using the top buttons, which will have a yellow outline when selected, then press the card you want to have those traits.</p>
                <p>Upon a correct input, the card will flip over to show the traits you selected. Upon an incorrect input, the card will flip over, strike, and flip back.</p>
                <p>A set is a triplet of cards that satisfy the following conditiions:</p>
                <ul>
                    <li>They all have the same number or have all different numbers of symbols (one, two, or three).</li>
                    <li>They all are the same or are all different colors (red, yellow, or blue).</li>
                    <li>They all have the same or all different shadings (empty, striped, or filled).</li>
                    <li>They all are the same or all different shapes (capsules, diamonds, or squiggles).</li>
                </ul>
