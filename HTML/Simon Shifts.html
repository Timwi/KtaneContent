                    <h2>On the Subject of Simon Shifts</h2>
                    <p class="flavour-text">I suppose this could’ve also been called “Simon Underneath Caps Lock”, but that doesn’t have a nice sound to it.</p>
                    <p>Eight tiles are colored red, orange, yellow, green, cyan, blue, purple, and magenta.
                    Some of these tiles will flash over three different stages.</p>
                    <p>Upon pressing a tile, the flashing sequence will stop.
                    If a tile that is next to the empty space with the status light is pressed, that tile will shift to the empty position.</p>
                    <p>Shift the tiles in such a way that the status light ends up in the middle of the module, while also making sure that the last set of tiles pressed all resulted in a shift, as well as the last set of tiles is equal to the set of tiles that flashed in order for that stage.</p>
                    <p>Stage 1 will have 3 flashes. Stage 2 will have 4 flashes. Stage 3 will have 5 flashes.</p>
                    <p>Once you have pressed all desired tiles, press the status light to submit that stage. Successfully completing all three stages will disarm the module.</p>
