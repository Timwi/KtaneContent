                <p>The module will display the exact same time and number of strikes as the normal timer, but the speaker will be on the other side.</p>
                <p style="font-size: 80%;">(Note: the timer will still have the strike indicator box on Hardcore mode.)</p>
                <p>To solve the module, select either the strike indicator box or the timer at the correct time using the rules below.</p>

                <ul>
                    <li>If the bomb has no strikes and there is a lit indicator with the label CAR, hold the timer and refer to "Releasing a Held Timer".</li>
                    <li>Otherwise, if the bomb has no strikes and there are two or more batteries on the bomb, press and immediately release the strike indicator.</li>
                    <li>Otherwise, if the timer display is currently less than 30 minutes, press and immediately release the timer.</li>
                    <li>Otherwise, if there are 2 or more batteries on the bomb, hold the timer and refer to "Releasing a Held Timer".</li>
                    <li>Otherwise, if there is a parallel port on the bomb, press and immediately release the strike indicator.</li>
                    <li>Otherwise, if the bomb has 2 strikes and there is a lit indicator with the label FRK, press and immediately release the timer.</li>
                    <li>Otherwise, if there is an unlit indicator with the label SND, press and immediately release the timer.</li>
                    <li>Otherwise, if the serial number contains an even number, press and immediately release the strike indicator.</li>
                    <li>Otherwise, if there is a serial port and at least one lit indicator on the bomb, hold the timer and refer to "Releasing a Held Timer".</li>
                    <li>Otherwise, if there are no indicators on the bomb, press and immediately release the timer.</li>
                    <li>Otherwise, if there are 2 or more lit indicators on the bomb, hold the strike indicator and refer to "Releasing a Held Strike Indicator".</li>
                    <li>Otherwise, if there are no batteries on the bomb, press and immediately release the strike indicator.</li>
                    <li>Otherwise, if the serial number contains a vowel, press and immediately release the timer.</li>
                    <li>Otherwise, if there are at least 2 port plates on the bomb, hold the timer and refer to "Releasing a Held Timer".</li>
                    <li>Otherwise, hold the timer and refer to "Releasing a Held Timer".</li>

                <ul>
                    <li>No strikes: release when the countdown timer has a 2 in any position, but only after holding for at least 3 seconds.</li>

                <h3>Releasing a Held Timer</h3>
                <p>Remember what the countdown timer displayed when you held it down. For each rule below, the rule is true if the countdown time was less than the time stated by the rule.</p>

                    <li>1 minute: release when the countdown timer has a 1 in any position, but only after holding for at least 1 second.</li>
