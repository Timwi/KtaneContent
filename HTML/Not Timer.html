                <p>The module will display the exact same time and number of strikes as the normal timer, but the speaker will be on the other side.</p>
                <p style="font-size: 80%;">(Note: the timer will still have the strike indicator box on Hardcore mode.)</p>
                <p>To solve the module, select either the strike indicator box or the timer at the correct time using the rules below.</p>

                <ul>
                    <li>If the bomb has no strikes and there is a lit indicator with the label CAR, hold the timer and refer to "Releasing a Held Timer".</li>
                    <li>Otherwise, if the bomb has no strikes and there are two or more batteries on the bomb, press and immediately release the strike indicator.</li>
                    <li>Otherwise, if the timer display is currently less than 30 minutes, press and immediately release the timer.</li>
                    <li>Otherwise, if there are 2 or more batteries on the bomb, hold the timer and refer to "Releasing a Held Timer".</li>
                    <li>Otherwise, if there is a parallel port on the bomb, press and immediately release the strike indicator.</li>
                    <li>Otherwise, if the bomb has 2 strikes and there is a lit indicator with the label FRK, press and immediately release the timer.</li>
                    <li>Otherwise, if there is an unlit indicator with the label SND, press and immediately release the timer.</li>
                    <li>Otherwise, if the serial number contains an even number, press and immediately release the strike indicator.</li>
                    <li>Otherwise, if there is a serial port and at least one lit indicator on the bomb, hold the timer and refer to "Releasing a Held Timer".</li>
                    <li>Otherwise, if there are no indicators on the bomb, press and immediately release the timer.</li>
                    <li>Otherwise, if there are 2 or more lit indicators on the bomb, hold the strike indicator and refer to "Releasing a Held Strike Indicator".</li>
                    <li>Otherwise, if there are no batteries on the bomb, press and immediately release the strike indicator.</li>
                    <li>Otherwise, if the serial number contains a vowel, press and immediately release the timer.</li>
