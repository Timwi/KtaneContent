                <h2>On the Subject of Mahjong Quiz (Hard)</h2>
                <p class="flavour-text">You thought this was simple didn’t you?</p>

                <p>
                    Now that you understand the basics the finding waits for mahjong hands it’s time to step it up.
                    The rules are the <a href="Mahjong Quiz Easy.html">same</a>, except that now the given hands will have more complex shapes.
                    Additionally, it is now possible for given hands to have <b>no</b> possible waits to keep you on your toes.
                    Recall that in mahjong there are only 4 copies of each tile.
                    If the given hand already contains 4 copies of the same tile, then that tile can not be a valid wait since you’d be waiting for a 5th non-existent tile.
                    If a hand has no possible waits click "CONFIRM" while no tiles have been selected.
