                <p class="flavour-text">I sure hope that you don’t get to see two of them on the same bomb.</p>
                <p class="appendix-reference">See Appendix COLORBLIND for how module changes when colorblind mode is active.</p>
                <p class="appendix-reference">See Appendix S for The Twin solves delay mod settings reference.</p>
                <p>This module contains 10 numbered buttons lining up in arcs and two screens at the bottom left corner where the smaller screen is located at the top right corner of the bigger screen.</p>
                <p>This module has 3 phases: Initial phase, Sequence phase, and Submission phase.</p>
                <p>The bigger screen is the stage number screen which will show the <strong>initial number</strong> during the initial phase, <strong>stage number</strong> during the sequence phase, and last 2 correctly submitted digits in the submission phase.</p>
                <p>The smaller screen is the module pair ID which will show the pair ID assigned to the module. The text on this screen will be white only when the module does not have a paired <strong>The Twin</strong> module.</p>
                <p>This module can only be solved after every other <a href="../More/Ignore%20Table.html#mod=TheTwinModule">non-ignored module</a> is solved or 101 non-ignored modules are solved. A strike will be given if upon an early interaction with the module. If the bomb has less than 2 of such module, <strong>The Twin</strong> will automatically disarm itself.</p>
                <p>In the initial phase, the module background will display both Morse code and color sequence simultaneously. The off state will be in gray color and the on state will be color from the color sequence. A long pause indicates the beginning of both Morse code and color sequence. Use Morse code chart and color sequence table to get two numbers. These number will be used to find the starting coordinates in the tables below color sequence table.</p>
                <p>Note that there are 8 possible colors that can appear on the module. They are Gray, Red (R), Green (G), Blue (B), Yellow (Y), White (W), Purple (P), and Emerald (E).</p>

                <p>When the module enters the sequence phase, the background will cycle up to 3 colors where exactly one of them is gray. This represents a total of 2 <strong>steps (implying that two steps can have the same color)</strong>. The gray color indicates the beginning of the first step in each stage. Each step is an instruction to generate the <strong>Final Sequence</strong> string. Follow the following instructions for each step to figure out the final sequence string:</p>
                <ol>
                    <li>Add 1 to the previous number. If this is the first step of the first stage, the previous number is the <strong>initial number</strong>.</li>
                    <li>Remove any digit of this new number that are in the current remove set. If this is the first step of the first stage, then such remove set is the remove set at the starting position of the remove set table.</li>
                    <li>Add that number after removing such digits to the end of the <strong>Final Sequence</strong> string. This string is initially empty.</li>
                    <li>From the current position in the color table, find the adjacent cell that has the same color as the color of this step. Note the direction that this cell is adjacent to the current position.</li>
                    <li>Move 1 cell towards that direction <strong>in sync</strong> for both tables. Both tables wrap around from top to bottom, left to right.</li>
                    <li>If the number on the stage number screen is red, then the current remove set is changed to the remove set in the current position in remove set table.</li>
                </ol>
                <p>If the <strong>Final Sequence</strong> string is still empty, then this string becomes a single character 0.</p>

                <p>When any of <strong>The Twin</strong> initiates a strike to the bomb in submission phase, both module (including the fake solved one) will start cycling through all of previous stages simultaneously.

                        <li>...Yellow, then the remove sets were traded including which step the remove set is changed. Trade them and generate the final sequence string as normal. Keep in mind that the steps when the stage number turns red are also swapped between modules.</li>
                    </ul>
                <p><strong>Note:</strong> If the module is running on Twitch Plays, the red display condition will never appear on the module.</p>
                <p>The functionality of the numbered buttons are also swapped between the pair. The numbered buttons of one module will enter digit into the other module. Make sure to take these into the account when submitting the final sequence strings. Submit the true final sequence strings to fake 'solve' the modules.</p>
                <p>When a module is fake solved, only one of the status lights in the pair will turn green. The bomb does not recognize that one of <strong>The Twin</strong> in the pair was solved. Submitting the second final sequence strings into the other module in the pair to turn the status light green will truly solve both modules.</p>

                <p>If the colorblind mode is active on <strong>The Twin</strong> that is not flipped horizontally, three additional texts will appear displaying first letter of the color with letter "A" representing gray. Two texts will be on the stage display screen. The text at the bottom-left of the screen shows the color of the display while the other one at the top-right of the screen shows the color of the module pair ID display. The third text will be near the status light showing the color of the background.</p>
                <h2>Appendix S: The Twin Mod Settings</h2>
                <p>When two instances of <strong>The Twin</strong> are fake solved, both modules will truly be solved. A timing delay can be added between each of true solves. The module is required to be loaded once to create the settings file and the delay is defaulted to 0. To change the settings, use mod selector tablets and select Mod Settings. Then, choose <strong>TheTwin</strong> to modify the settings for The Twin. In the settings, there is a <code>SecondDelay</code> field. Enter any number of seconds into this field to change the delay between solves. Entering negative numbers will set the actual delay to 0 seconds.</p>
