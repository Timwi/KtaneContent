                <h2>On the Subject of Navigating Nomai</h2>
                <p class="flavour-text">So essentially how not to get lost in deep space.</p>

                <p>
                    A Nomai module presents you with 5 small spheres, one of them glowing, a large button on the bottom, a blue timer up top which is slowly turning more gray as time goes on,
                    and an interactable status light. The glowing sphere will be referred to as the ‘sun’ and the other spheres as ‘planets’, the button on bottom as the ‘main planet’ and the status light as the status light.
                </p>

                <p>
                    Pressing the planets will either make you move to the planet you pressed, will make you move to a dark purple planet (known as the 6th planet),
                    or will make the timer immediately deplete. The timer will also immediately reset if you try to travel to the sun. (In very rare circumstances, this will take you to the 6th planet instead.)
                    Pressing the Main Planet or Status light will have a chance to change the colour of the timer, which will be important later.
                </p>

                <p>
                    The timer at the top of the module, once depleted, will return everything you did before it emptied back to its original state, and the module will essentially loop,
                    whilst displaying you got either a strike or solve for a brief moment, whilst not actually performing either action.
                    Your goal is to end this time loop by following a specific condition, turning the timer a certain colour, and navigating to a certain 6th planet, which isn’t shown on the module.
                </p>

                <p>
                    To start, we need to figure out the condition that will end the time looping mechanism, so that we don’t end it too early, and cause a REAL strike.
                    This can be found by taking the main planet you start on in the following table:
                </p>

                <p>(Note: When it says to interact with a planet, make that planet the main planet and then interact with it)</p>

                <p>Once you have figured out the condition, do NOT follow the condition until you know you can solve the module within that time loop.</p>

                <p>Now this part requires a good bit of moving between planets and experimentation, as to get to the 6th location, you need to move from 1 planet to another in a specific order,
                    which is not predetermined and is essentially completely random.</p>

                    After you have located the 6th planet and have a route which can take you there, we need to figure out the timer  colour which makes the time loop temporarily solve rather than strike
                    To do this also takes some experimentation, as you will have to figure out what changes the timer colour.
                    To do this, on each planet you go to, press either the main planet or the status light.
                    Most of the time, this will do absolutely nothing, but sometimes, it will cause the timer to change to a certain colour.
                    After it changes to this certain colour, navigate to the 6th planet and wait for the timer to run out.
                    If the status light turns green for a moment, it indicates that’s the correct colour you need to use to solve the module.
                    If not, try to find a different colour. The possible colours are Red, Cyan, and Green. One of them will always turn it green.
                </p>

                <p>
                    Once you have figured out the correct colour, condition, and the 6th planet, you need to change the timer to the correct colour, move to the 6th planet, AND follow the condition.
                    Once all 3 of those are done in succession within 1 reset, the module will, instead of looping again, actually solve.
                    If either you weren’t on the 6th planet or the colour of the timer is wrong, you will get a REAL strike, so be careful.
                </p>
