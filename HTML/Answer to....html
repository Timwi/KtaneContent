								<h2>On the Subject of Answer to...</h2>
								 <p class="flavour-text">You think you know the answers to a lot of things? Well, think again.</p>
								<ul>
									<li>This module contains a number pad with the digits 0-9, a clear button, and a submit button. Additionally, 6 colored LEDs are present, and a bigger light closer to the top.</li>
									<li>To disarm the module, first obtain the original index using an equation, then modify this value based on the color of the light to the right of the number pad.</li>
									<li>Based on the number obtained, modify a number it corresponds to once more, and submit that to solve the module.</li>
								</ul>
								<h3>Step 1:</h3>
								<p>You must use the following equation to calculate the original index for the module:</p>
								<p><strong>ORIGINAL INDEX</strong> = (batteries * battery holders) + (lit * unlit) + (unique ports * port plates)</p>
								<h3>Step 2:</h3>
								<p>After obtaining the original index, you must modify it using the table below based on the color of the light.</p>
								<div class='tableScroller'>

														<li>Otherwise, if only a serial port is present, add 6 then modulo 30 .</li>
														<li>Otherwise, if only a parallel port is present, subtract 26 then modulo 30.</li>
														<li>Otherwise, add 1 then modulo 30.</li>

														<li>Otherwise, if there is an unlit CAR indicator present, double the index then modulo 30.</li>
														<li>Otherwise, divide the number by 2 then modulo 30.</li>
