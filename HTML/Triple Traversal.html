                    <h2>On the Subject of Triple Traversal</h2>
                    <p class="flavour-text">Discussion about restaurant placemat factories has always been a gray area since the accident...</p>
                    <p>You are located in three different mazes at once, each in a different position. The walls of all three mazes are shown on the screen surrounding the button, in varying shades of gray based on how many walls surround your current position. The walls will either be black, dark gray, light gray, or white, representing 0, 1, 2, and 3 different mazes that have a wall in that direction.</p>
                    <p>Initially, walls are ignored, and you can travese the mazes freely. This will help you deduce where in the mazes you are in. The screen at the top left will show a dash, indicating you have not entered a maze yet. Once you have determined your position in all three mazes, press the middle button. The screen at the top left will then indicate which maze you are in.</p>
                    <p>You will start in Maze A. Travel to the central cell in the maze, while respecting the walls of that maze. The walls of Mazes B and C will be displayed, but are ignored and can be passed through freely. Once you have reached the central cell in Maze A, press the middle button.</p>
                    <p>Repeat this process for Mazes B and C, travelling to the central cell, and respecting the walls of those mazes. The module will disarm upon successfully pressing the middle button at the central cell for all three mazes.</p>
                    <p>If, at any point, you walk into a wall, or press the middle button while not at the central cell of the maze, a strike will be incurred, and you will return to the initial state, where all the walls are ignored. Your current position will not change upon a strike.</p>
