                <h2>On the Subject of Meme Review</h2>
                <p class="flavour-text">I would prefer devin over a political conversation anyday.</p>

                <p>The moderators on imgflip.com's ai_memes stream have been getting tired of seeking out memes to review for quality. They came up with this clever contraption to make their job easier, so you do the searching instead!</p>
                <p>A meme will be displayed from the stream located <a href="https://imgflip.com/m/ai_memes">here</a>. The moderators commonly like to review memes that are on the first page of the stream, so if the displayed meme is on the first page when sorting the stream by "New" or "Hot" then press the review button to send the meme to the moderators. Any other meme the moderators will not accept for review, so if this is the case for the displayed meme press the regen button to fetch another one.</p>
                <p>Pressing the regen button when the displayed meme should be sent in for review or pressing the review button when the displayed meme should not be sent in for review will cause a strike.</p>
                <p><strong>NOTE: The module depends on a connection to the internet to fetch memes from the stream, so if the module ever displays "Error" then that means it failed to connect. If this occurs, press the review button to solve the module. DO NOT press the regen button if this happens as it will cause a strike.</strong></p>
