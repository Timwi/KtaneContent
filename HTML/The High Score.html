                        <li>This module is laid out like an arcade machine, and contains two arrow buttons, a green submit button, and a red back button.</li>
                        <li>Use the arrow buttons to change the current character, then use the green submit button to enter and move to the next character.

                        <li>When the third character in the name is entered, the name will be automatically submitted.</li>
                        <li>Using the table below, start at the index that matches the first character in the serial number. Numbers are prefixed with #.</li>
                        <li>Evaluate the condition for that row, and if it is true, apply the corresponding rule. Then move down to the next row.</li>
                        <li>Continue evaluating rows until all three characters of the name have been defined, then submit that name to disarm the module.</li>

                    <ul>
                        <li>The first rule that defines any character of the name is final. Ignore any future attempts to redefine that character.</li>
                        <li>If a rule says to “jump” to a character, the next row to evaluate is the row with the index that the rule specifies.</li>
                        <li>If a rule refers to the “previous character”, use the character that was most recently defined. If no characters have been defined, use the first letter in the serial number instead.
                        <li>If a rule defines the “next character”, it defines the leftmost character of the name that has yet to be defined.</li>
                        <li>If a rule says a character is “plus” or “minus” a number, do a Caesar shift on that character by the specified amount. E + 1 = F, E - 1 = D, Z + 1 = A, etc.</li>
