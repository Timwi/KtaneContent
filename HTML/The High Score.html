                    <li>This module is laid out like an arcade machine, and contains two arrow buttons, a green submit button, and a red back button.</li>
                    <li>Use the arrow buttons to change the current character, then use the green submit button to enter and move to the next character.
                        <br><span style="font-style: italic;">(The arrow buttons can be held down to quickly cycle through characters.)</span></li>
                    <li>When the third character in the name is entered, the name will be automatically submitted.</li>
                    <li>Using the table below, start at the index that matches the first character in the serial number. Numbers are prefixed with #.</li>
                    <li>Evaluate the condition for that row, and if it is true, apply the corresponding rule. Then move down to the next row.</li>
                    <li>Continue evaluating rows until all three characters of the name have been defined, then submit that name to disarm the module.</li>
