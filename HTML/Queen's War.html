                <h2>On the Subject of Queen’s War</h2>
                <p class="flavour-text">Tap out while you can, the Queen of Spades always gets her way.</p>
                <p>This module will have a stage counter in the bottom right and a playing card pile in the middle. The pile will start with one card.</p>
                <p>Every time a <a href="../More/Ignore Table.html#mod=queensWarModule">non-ignored module</a> is solved the stage counter will increase by one and another playing card will be placed on the pile. Your goal is to keep count of each suit’s wins in this modified game of war by the Queen of Spades. <em>Note that the Queen of Spades has declared that aces will be worth one in this game.</em> If the new card’s rank is higher than the previous card in the pile, then increase the win count of the suit of that card. After all non-ignored modules are solved, the stage counter and pile will disappear and four cards will be placed in the middle with the four suits on them. Press these suit cards in order of greatest win count to least to solve the module.</p>
                <p>If a card is pressed more than once or a card is pressed with a greater win count than the one pressed before it, a strike will occur and the module will briefly show each stage again.</p>
                <p>Note that whenever the newly placed card has the same rank as the previous card, then the suit’s win counts will cycle around. Initially they are in the order of spades, hearts, diamonds and clubs but will cycle one to the right whenever this happens.</p>
