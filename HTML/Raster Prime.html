                <h2>On the Subject of Raster Prime</h2>
                <p class="flavour-text">LRRLRRRLR LLRLLRL</p>

                <p>On the module are a large number of diamond-shaped pixels coloured in cyan. To solve the module, input the correct sequence of left and right, using the highlightable regions on the module, or your keyboard.</p>
                <p>The groups of larger pixels on the left and right show the shapes the figure in the middle is composed of.</p>
                <p>The shapes must be inputted in a specific order as described below:</p>
                <ul>
                    <li>Any pixels that have not been covered by a shape yet and are (edge-)adjacent to the current shape must be part of the next.</li>
                    <li>If there are no such pixels, the next shape uses the topmost pixel(s) that have yet to be covered.</li>
                </ul>
                <p>The module will not strike or reset in any scenario and solves if at any point the correct shapes have been entered consecutively.</p>
                <p>See the flavour text and module svg for an example solution.</p>
                <h3>About the puzzle generation</h3>
                <ul>
                    <li>The puzzle will always have exactly one solution.</li>
                    <li>The two shapes will always be each other's counterparts:
                        <ul>
                            <li>The counterpart of a shape is a horizontally mirrored version, unless this does not change the shape.</li>
                            <li>Otherwise the counterpart of a shape is a vertically mirrored version, unless this does not change the shape.</li>
                            <li>Otherwise the counterpart of a shape counterpart is a 90 degree rotated version, unless this does not change the shape.</li>
                            <li>Otherwise the counterpart of a shape is a 3x3 grid with only the positions present that were not present in the shape.</li>
                        </ul>
                    </li>
                </ul>
