                    <p class="flavour-text">What... is your favourite colour? Blue. No, yellOOOOOOOW!!</p>

					<p> This module consists of four pink buttons, each with a flashing color next to them. </p>                   
						
                        <h3>Tips for Success</h3>
                        <ul>
                            <li>In order to solve this module, you must submit four 4-digit codes in sequence. Each 4-digit code you enter has a sequence number. The first 4-digit code you enter has a sequence number of 1, the second has a sequence number of 2, etc.</li>
							<li>Each button from top to bottom has a color flashing next to it.</li>
							<li>These flashing lights can be decoded into 4 "keys", each of which is a letter.</li>
							<li>Each flashing light follows one of four patterns: Morse Code, Tap Code, a sequence of colors, and a number of long flashes between 1 and 7.</li>
							<li>The morse code and tap codes are deciphered in the usual way (see morse code or tap code manuals for help). These will provide you with the <strong>Morse Key</strong> and <strong>Tap Key</strong>.</li>
							<li>The sequence of colors corresponds to the 4 colors associated with the buttons, in order, from top to bottom, and a fifth color, which is the <strong>Color Key</strong>. Use the first letter of the name of this color as the <strong>Color Key</strong>.</li>
							<li>The last code will simply be a number of flashes between 1 and 7. These flashes are longer than the morse code dash length to help differentiate between the two. The <strong>Number Key</strong> is the letter in the corresponding position of this list <strong>R G B M C Y W</strong>.</li>
							<li>Now that you have the four keys, you will use these keys as inputs to decrypt the 4-digit codes from each color.</li>
							<li>You only need to determine the 4-digit codes for the colors which correspond to each button.</li>
							<li>The order you need to submit the codes is the same as the order of the colors from top to bottom, or the first four colors of the color sequence, which is equivalent.</li>
							<li>The key for the first color is the <strong>Color Key</strong>. The order of the keys for the remaining colors continues from the location of the <strong>Color Key</strong> downward, wrapping around as necessary.</li>
							<li>The instructions to determine the 4-digit code for each color can be found below.</li>

					<ul>
							<li>When you are ready to submit the codes, note the following things:
								<ul>
                                    <li>When you enter a 4-digit code, treat the buttons as numbered 1-4 starting from the button associated with the current color and proceeding downward, and wrapping around as necessary.</li>
                                    <li>The module will only issue a strike after the 4-digit code is submitted. If you receive a strike, the current color code will be deleted and you need to enter it again.</li>
									<li>When a 4-digit code is entered correctly, the button associated with that color will turn green. Once all four buttons are green the module is solved.</li>
                                </ul>
							</li>
					</ul>
                    <h3>Red</h3>
						<ol>
							<li>Convert the input key to a 2-digit number using the alphanumeric position of the key with A = 1, etc.</li>
							<li>If the number is less than 10, keep the leading 0. (01, 02, etc.)</li>
							<li>Add to this number the number of ports on the bomb which contain the letter <strong>R</strong> in their name. If the number is now greater than 99, use the 2 least significant digits.</li>
							<li>Convert each of the two digits to 1 if they are odd, and 0 if they are even.</li>
							<li>Consult the table of logic gates to determine which gate you should use, where the sequence number corresponds with which 4-digit code you are currently calculating.</li>
							<li>Use the two digits as the input for the gate, with 1 being true and 0 being false (See Appendix A for help with logic gates).</li>
							<li>Now, find your code in the table based on whether the output of the logic gate.</li>

					<ol>
						<li>To find the 4-digit combination, we will use a special encryption on the word <strong>YELLOW</strong>, which will depend on the key.</li>
						<li>First remove the letter from the word <strong>YELLOW</strong> which is closest to the key letter. Ties are broken in favor of the letter further in the alphabet. If the letter to remove is <strong>L</strong> only remove one of them.</li>
						<li>Now find the inverse letter of the key (A->Z,B->Y,C->X,etc.) and repeat step 2.</li>
						<li>You should have 4 letters left in the word <strong>YELLOW</strong>. Shift these letters to the right based on the sequence number, wrapping the letters around as needed.</li>
						<li>Now replace the letters with numbers 1-4 based on the order in which they appear in the alphabet (Ex. AFDH = 1324). This is your solution.</li> 										
					</ol>
					
					<h3>White</h3>
					<ul>
						<li>Using the key, and the current sequence number, choose any of the other 6 colors, and any of the 4-digit combinations they produce will work as the solution for this color.</li>
						<li><strong>NOTE:</strong> Since you are using a new key and this 4-digit code corresponds to a different sequence number, it is highly unlikely that the 4-digit code produced by a color will be the same, so entering the same code you already entered for another color on the module likely will not work!</li>
