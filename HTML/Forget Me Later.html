                <h2>On the Subject of Forget Me Later</h2>
                <p class="flavour-text">Don’t judge a book by its cover.<br>Judge it by its blurb.</p>
                <p>Initially, the module will cycle through a sequence of digits shown on the bottom screen.<br>This sequence has as many steps as there are <a href="../More/Ignore Table.html#mod=forgetMeLater">non-ignored modules</a> on the bomb.</p>
                <p>Solving one non-ignored module will cause the module to enter into its input phase, revealing two input digits on the bottom screen.</p>
                <p>After each solve, a single input is required. This input is given by the last digit of the absolute value of the output of the rule that corresponds to the number shown in the small display.</p>
                <p>There are sixty possible functions to apply.</p>
                <p>If an incorrect input is made, the correct input will be shown on the bottom screen and the sequence of original digits will be shown once again before the buttons can be pressed.</p>
                <p>A strike will be incurred from each incorrect input, and each skipped stage.</p>
