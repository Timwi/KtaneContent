                <h2>On the Subject of Bad Bones</h2>
                <p class="flavour-text">A skull on a gearstick stares back at you ominously.</p>
                
                
                <p>
                    This module consists of a metallic skull with one blue and
                    one red eye attached to a gearstick, as well as four sets of
                    bones positioned as Roman numerals.
                </p>
                <p>
                    The skull can be dragged in any direction. Releasing the
                    skull will cause it to return to the center.
                </p>
                <p>
                    To input a value, drag the skull to the relevant set of bones and release it above
                    them. A noise will play corresponding to that set of bones. If no noise plays, the
                    input was not submitted.
                    <!--<br>A deaf version of this module can be accessed by pressing the red eye <b>three</b> times,
                    then the blue eye once. An alternative manual is available for this version.-->
                </p>
                <p>
                    Both eyes can be pressed. The blue eye will submit the current sequence of
                    inputs. The red eye will delete all inputs.
                </p>
                <p>Use the information below to find the correct sequence.</p>
                
                <h3>B-B-B-B-B-B-B-Bad</h3>
                <p>
                    One of the bone groups on the bomb is a <b>Bad Bone</b>. Entering a sequence containing
                    a Bad Bone will result in a strike. If your sequence contains a Bad Bone, it
                    should be replaced with the corresponding <b>Good Bone</b> after every other rule has
                    been followed.
                </p>
                <h4>Finding The Bad Bone</h4>
                <p>
                    When releasing the skull over the bones, two bones will play the same note.
                    These are the Good and Bad Bones.
                </p>
                <p>
                    If the blue eye is on the left, the lower-value bone is the Bad Bone. Otherwise,
                    the higher-value bone is the Bad Bone.<br>
                    The other bone out of the pair is the Good Bone.
                </p>
                <h3>Sequence Length</h3>
                <p>
                    Add up the numbers (ignore letters) in your serial number. This is the length of
                    your sequence. If this value is 0, instead use the number of <b>solved</b> modules on
                    the bomb as your sequence length, <b>plus 1</b>.
                </p>

                <h3>Determining the Sequence</h3>
                <p>
                    Move down the table, stopping at the <b>first</b> condition that matches. Follow the
                    first priority rule for this condition.<br>
                    Repeat the process, <b>ignoring</b> any conditions that have been fulfilled before
                    (excluding ‘Otherwise’), following the next priority rule for each condition.
                </p>
                <p>
                    In cases of conflict, earlier priority rules override those with later priority
                    unless explicitly stated otherwise, and are followed first.<br>
                    Follow ‘future’ rules after all other rules but before Sequence Modifiers.
