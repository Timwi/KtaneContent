                <p class="flavour-text">Triplets, now?</p>

                <p>This module initially is covered by a rectangular panel. When highlighted, this module will show the
                    letter Z. If you see an X or Y, you are looking at a different module.</p>
                <p>The Z key on your keyboard is linked to this module. Pressing the key will open the panel. The panel
                    always rotates open.</p>
                <p>Once opened, the squares flash a sequence of black and white, corresponding to a specific
                    word in the list below. However, the Z has been removed from the word, and there is no gap between
                    the end and start of it.</p>
                <p>Treating exactly one square being white as a signal, the squares will transmit <a
                        href="Morse Code.html">Morse Code</a>.</p>
                <p>To submit an answer, select at the module and hold down the Z key. Music will begin playing with
                    strong clicks on the beat. Release after exactly as many beats have passed as the position of the
                    word in the list. Releasing after 0 or 8 beats will have no penalty, however a wrong answer will
                    incur a strike.</p>
