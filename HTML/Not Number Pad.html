                <ul>
                    <li>Each button will be colored. Initially the number buttons will not do anything. Press the enter button to begin the module.</li>
                    <li>Afterwards, the numbered buttons will begin to flash. Multiple buttons may flash at once. From these buttons and their colors, determine another number to submit. For each stage, submit the answers from the previous stages before submitting the current stage. There will be 3 stages.
                        <table class="priorities">

                        <li>Take the color of the <strong>enter</strong> button in the table to the right and move down a number of rows equal to the current stage. This is the priority order. Order the flashing numbers by this order to get a number. This number will be used in the final step.</li>

                <ul>
                    <li>For each stage, Start with the rule in the stage’s rule list whose number is the digital root of the flashing numbers and continue downwards (wrapping around if necessary) until a true statement is reached.</li>
                    <li>If no true statement is ever reached, use the number of the starting row.</li>
                    <li>Once a true statement is reached, reference its position in the table below in conjunction with the color of the <strong>clear</strong> button to obtain a number.</li>
                      <li>Multiply this number by the number obtained from ordering the stage digits to determine the number to submit for that stage. If the answer is more than four digits, submit the rightmost four.</li>
                      <li>Submitting the incorrect number will cause a strike and reset all inputs for the stage.</li>
