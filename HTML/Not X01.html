                <p class="flavour-text">Presumption and a sweaty hand are the keys to all bomb-related accidents.</p>
                <p>This module consists of a 10-section dartboard with sector value numbering along the edges. Note the north-facing sector of the dartboard is green-tan on this module.</p>
                <p>Select the bullseye to activate the module. Once activated, the module will hide the sector values and flash a sequence of six sectors with a pause between repeats.</p>
                <p>Determine the base set that consists of the sectors that are directed to by an odd number of true statements in List A.</p>
                <p>Alter the base set using the modification that corresponds to the first true statement in List B.</p>
                <p>Select the sectors belonging to the altered set and submit them by pressing the bullseye.<br>Be careful, once a sector is selected, it cannot be deselected again and the sequence will stop flashing until after submission.</p>
                <p>If the submission is correct the module will progress to the next of three stages, lengthening the sequence of flashes by three.
                    <br>Upon an incorrect submission, the module will enter standby and reveal the sector values once again.</p>
