                <h2>On the Subject of Withered Bonnie</h2>
                <p class="flavour-text">“What is this new prison? Is it me trapped or is it you? Perhaps it's us both.”</p>

                <p>You will be inside the Five Nights at Freddy's 2 office with a mask button on the bottom of the screen and a toxicity meter at the bottom left.</p>
                
                <p>Using your mouse you will put in the Freddy Fazbear Mask. Randomly when the Needy activates Withered Bonnie will appear in your office so put on the mask to send him away.</p>

                <p>Don't use the mask too much or wear it for too long or you will fail hard on your toxicity meter. It will go down as the bomb continues.</p>

                <p>Getting Caught or a Full Toxicity Meter will cause a strike.</p>
