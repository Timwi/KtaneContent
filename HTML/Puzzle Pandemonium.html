                <ul>
                    <li>Four 4×4 grids will be present on the module, but exactly one of them will display information while the others are hidden.</li>
                    <li>Each 4×4 grid is a different puzzle, where each cell can be selected to affect that puzzle. You must solve each puzzle shown on the module in order to disarm this module.</li>
                    <li>Each puzzle is linked to another puzzle such that clicking on one cell in the first puzzle will click on the same cell in another puzzle. It may not be explicit in which puzzles are linked up to which, but the links will be circular.</li>
                    <li>After an indeterminate amount of clicks, the puzzle you were on will hide itself, and a new one will be shown. However, whenever any active puzzle is solved, that puzzle will no longer be able to reveal itself, and a new link chain will be formed.</li>
                    <li>The next page will explain the types of puzzles that can be found on the module as well as their rules.</li>

                <h4>Pipes (Plumbing)</h4>
                <ul>
                    <li>Rotate all of the pipes such that they are all connected in a single group.</li>
                    <li>To solve this puzzle, all pipes must have an opening connected to another pipe. (i.e. no leaks)</li>
                </ul>
                <h4>Lights Out</h4>
                <ul>
                    <li>Each cell can either be on or off.</li>
                    <li>Pressing any cell will toggle its state, as well as all other immediate orthogonal neighbors. (Left, Right, Up, Down)</li>
                    <li>Turn every cell off to complete the puzzle.</li>
                </ul>
                <h4>Sudoku</h4>
                <ul>
                    <li>Each cell has a value from one to four.</li>
                    <li>Each row, column, and 2×2 region must have exactly one of each number from one to four.</li>
                    <li>Select a cell to cycle between numbers 1 – 4 respectively.</li>
                    <li>Some cells will be filled in beforehand, and cannot be cycled.</li>
                </ul>
                <h4>Kakurasu</h4>
                <ul>
                    <li>Each cell can have a black square, and each black square has a value.</li>
                    <li>The cell’s value for the column is its position in the column going top to bottom (1 – 4).</li>
                    <li>The cell’s value for the row is its position in the row going left to right (1 – 4).</li>
                    <li>Fill in the grid in such a way that each row and column have black squares that sum to the values indicated on the sides.</li>
