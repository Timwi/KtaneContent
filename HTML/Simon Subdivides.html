                <p class="flavour-text">This is like one of those toys you played with as kid where you have one of those toys you played with as a kid, except this one is one of those toys you played with as a kid purchased like one those toys you played with as a kid.</p>
                <p>Initially, this module consists of four cells, each distinctly coloured either red, green, blue, or violet. This initial configuration of four cells will be referred to as Generation One (G1).</p>
                <p>These cells will flash in sequence with a long pause between repeats. This sequence of colours is to be used to construct a sequence of inputs:</p>
                <ul>
                    <li>
                        If the cells are in their intial state, the initial colour is determined by the following:
                        <ul>
                            <li>The initial colour is the first of the letters B, G, R, or V to occur in the serial number.</li>
                            <li>If none of the four letters occur in the serial number, the initial colour is the colour of the top cell.</li>
                        </ul>
                        Otherwise, the initial colour changes every two subdivisions:
                        <ul>
                            <li>Consider the G1 cell with the current initial colour.</li> 
                            <li>The new initial colour is the colour of the G1 cell at a 90&deg; clockwise rotation to that cell.</li>
                        </ul>
                        <li>
                            Find the correct grid to use:
                            <ul>
                                <li>Take the last digit of the serial number.</li>
                                <li>Add the number of subdivisions that have occured on this module.</li>
                                <li>If the sum exceeds 4, subtract 5 until it drops below 5.</li>
                                <li>The correct grid is indicated by this number.</li>
                            </ul>
                        <li>
                            Construct the input sequence using the grid: 
                            <ul>
                                <li>The first direction in the input sequence is given by the row corresponding to the initial colour and the column corresponding to the colour of the first flashing cell.</li>
                                <li>All other directions are given by the row corresponding to the previous flashing colour and the column corresponding to the current flashing colour.</li>
                                <li>If the flashing cell does not belong to G1, multiple directions are added given by the row corresponding to the initial colour/colour of the previous flashing cell and the columns corresponding to the colours of the undivided cells of each of its generations, starting with G1.</li>
                            </ul>
                        </li>
                    </ul>

            <p>For each direction in the input sequence, select the cell in that direction.<br>If that cell has subdivided, the next direction refers to the daughter cell relative to the subdivided parent cell.</p>
            <p>If the sequence ends on a subdivided cell, wrap around to the beginning of the input sequence.</p>
            <p>Once all of the correct inputs have been made:</p>
            <ul>
                <li>If the last cell to be pressed is a G3 cell, the module will be defused.</li>
                <li>Otherwise the last cell to be pressed will subdivide into four cells of the next generation.</li>

            <p>If any input is incorrect, the module will immediately strike and generate a new sequence of flashing cells.</p>
