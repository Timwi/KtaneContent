                <h2>On the Subject of A Letter</h2>
                <p class="flavour-text">“Echo Hotel” “Hotel” ... “Bravo”</p>
                <p>In the middle of the module is a display with a letter in it.</p>
                <p>Pressing the display will make it cycle between letters.</p>
                <p>To solve this module, the correct letters must be pressed and the incorrect letters must be ignored.</p>
                <p>If an incorrect letter is pressed, or if a correct letter is ignored, the module will give a strike. </p>
                <p>The correct letters are those which are in the same position as they are in the list (See below).</p>
                <p>The letter that is currently on display counts as the letter in the first position. The letter that shows up immediately after pressing the display counts as the letter in the second position. </p>
                <p>After pressing all 26 letters, the module will solve.</p>
                <p>Keep in mind that all of the letters pass by very quickly. Also note that after pressing the display, the next letter will immediately show up. </p>         
                <h3>Generating the list</h3>
                <p></p>
                    <ul>
                        <li>The first letter is the letter that is currently on display.</li>
                        <li>The second letter is in the <var>n</var>th position in the remaining list of letters, where <var>n</var> is the alphabetic position of the first letter in the serial number. (e.g. if the first letter was B, the remaining list of letters would be ACDEFGH...)</li>
                        <li>The third letter is in the <var>n</var>th position in the remaining list of letters, where <var>n</var> is first number in the serial number. If it is a 0, change it to a 1.</li>
                        <li>The fourth letter is in the <var>x</var>th position in the remaining list of letters, where <var>x</var> is the alphabetic position of the letter that is in the list three place before this one's. (e.g. if the list was ABCD, <var>x</var> would be the alphabetic position of B.)</li>
                    </ul>
                <p>Looping around the remaining list of letters is required if the position that needs to be reached is greater than the remaining list of letters.<p> 
                <p>Repeat step 4 until you have 26 characters in the list.</p>
