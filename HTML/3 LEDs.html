                    <h2>On the Subject of 3 LEDs</h2>
                    <p class="flavour-text">For those who don't find LEDs interesting enough.</p>
                    
					<p>This module has 3 LEDs in the center of it with a small black button between them. Each of them may be colored white, red, green, blue, or yellow and may be in an on or off state. Clicking an LED will toggle its current state.</p>
                
					<p>To solve the module put each LED into its correct state and press the black button to submit the states. To determine each LED's correct state, figure out if the initial states of the LEDs are in the table below where black is off and white is on, and if so then follow the rules below the table. Otherwise, take each digit in the serial number and if any are greater than or equal to 3 subtract 3 until they are not. Then add 1 to each digit and assign each LED with the numbers 1 through 3 in reading order, and toggle each LED based on the digits received from the serial number in left to right order.</p>
				
					<p>If the wrong LED states are submitted a strike will be recorded and the module will return to its initial state.</p>

						<li>If an LED is red, its correct state is the state that is in that LED's position in the picture above the initial in the table, looping around if necessary.</li>
						<li>If an LED is blue, its correct state is the state that is in that LED's position in the picture below the initial in the table, looping around if necessary.</li>
						<li>If an LED is green, its correct state is the state that is in that LED's position in the picture to the left of the initial in the table, looping around if necessary.</li>
						<li>If an LED is yellow, its correct state is the state that is in that LED's position in the picture to the right of the initial in the table, looping around if necessary.</li>
						<li>If an LED is white, its correct state is the opposite of its initial state.</li>
