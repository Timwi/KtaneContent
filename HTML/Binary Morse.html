                <h2>On the Subject of Binary Morse</h2>

                <p>This module consists of two screens, a keypad, a submit button and clear button. The screen cycles an indefinite amount of decimal numbers per second.</p>
                <p>These sequence of numbers, when converted into seven-digit binary numbers, show a repeated transmission of a morse code letter for each significant digit.</p>
                <p>A dot is defined as one "1" between zeroes, while a dash is defined as three consecutive "1"s between zeroes. A single "0" between two "1"s is defined as a gap between two parts of a letter, while three consecutive "0"s is defined as a gap between whole letters.</p>
                <p>Each significant digit would only transmit one letter at a time repeatedly. Determine the letters transmitted by each significant digit of the binary, then convert them into morse code.</p>
                <p>From left to right, convert a dot to one "1", a dash to three consecutive "1"s, a space between two parts in a letter to one "0", and a space between two whole letters to three consecutive "0"s.</p>
                <p>If the length of this binary string isn't divisible by 8, prepend zeroes until it is.</p>
                <p>Next, split up the binary string into groups of 8, from left to right. Convert these groups into decimal numbers and take their sum.</p>
                <p>Submit this number into the module to solve it. A strike will occur for a wrong answer, but will not reset the module.</p>
