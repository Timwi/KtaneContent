                        <p class="flavour-text">Experience the feeling of both sides of the team!</p>

                        <p class="appendix-reference" id="appendix-reference">See Appendix A for indicator identification reference.<br>See Appendix B for battery identification reference.<br>See Appendix C for port identification reference.</p>

                        <p>You are not the only one with the manual now.
                            The module contains a big screen, two buttons, saying
                            "Previous" and "Next", and a switch.
                            To disarm the module, use both of your manuals to work
                            together and determine what to do next.</p>

                        <p>We advise you to check the section "Weird Quirks" before starting to solve the module.</p>
                        <p>Follow the instructions on the module's screen. You may press the "Previous" button to check previous sets of instructions. However, the display may partially or totally glitch out in those sets.</p>
                        <p>The screen may instruct you to apply certain rules. Refer to the section "Rules" when this happens.</p>

                        <br>

                                ports or port types will return false no matter what.</b> Port plates is a different category,

                        <h3>Flipping the Switch</h3>

                        <p>Once you have gone through each set of instructions, the module will tell you to
                                flip the switch down. Once you do that, the display will cycle through a set of keywords.
                                Flip the switch back up when a valid keyword is on the screen to
                                disarm the module. Flipping the switch down before the module tells you to will skip right to
                                the keyword submission phase, but will not register a strike. However, like when the "Previous" button
                                is pressed, keywords may appear partially or totally glitched.</p>

                        <p>Flipping the switch back up when an invalid keyword is showing, however, will
                                register a strike and return to the first set of instructions. A strike may or may not change
                                the sets of instructions previously displayed.</p>

                        <p>Use the table below to identify which keywords are valid:</p>
