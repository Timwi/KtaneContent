                <p class="appendix-reference" id="appendix-reference">See Appendix A for indicator identification reference.<br>See Appendix B for battery identification reference.<br>See Appendix C for port identification reference.</p>

                <p>You are not the only one with the manual now.
                    The module contains a big screen, two buttons, saying
                    “Previous” and “Next”, and a switch.
                    To disarm the module, use both of your manuals to work
                    together and determine what to do next.</p>

                <p>We advise you to check the section “Weird Quirks” before starting to solve the module.</p>
                <p>Follow the instructions on the module’s screen. You may press the “Previous” button to check previous sets of instructions. However, the display may partially or totally glitch out in those sets.</p>
                <p>The screen may instruct you to apply certain rules. Refer to the section “Rules” when this happens.</p>

                <br>
                <h3>Rules</h3>

                <p class="highlightable">A : “If the serial number contains a vowel, take the sum of all the digits in
                    the serial number with the number of batteries. Subtract that number from
                    the current Key Number.”</p>
                <p class="highlightable">B : “If there are more than 3 batteries on the bomb, subtract the last digit of the
                    serial number from your current Key Number.”</p>
                <p class="highlightable">C : “If there is a Parallel port on the bomb, add the number of battery
                    holders to your current Key Number.”</p>
                <p class="highlightable">D : “If there are more than 2 port plates on the bomb, add the number of
                    ports present on the bomb to your current Key Number.”</p>
                <p class="highlightable">E : “If the serial number contains a prime digit, subtract 5 plus the
                    amount of unlit indicators on the bomb from your current Key Number.”</p>
                <p class="highlightable">F : “If there is a Stereo RCA port on the bomb, multiply your current Key
                    Number by the number of lit indicators on the bomb.”</p>
                <p class="highlightable">G : “If the last applied rule was a vowel (and there is a last rule applied), divide your current Key
                    Number in half, rounding down to the nearest integer.”</p>

                        it by the last digit of the serial number, then add that number to your

                <p>Check all of these conditions to confirm your weird quirks.
                    You might regret not reading this later.</p>

                <p class="highlightable">1. If there are at least 3 indicators on the bomb, and all of them are lit,
                    <b>W and Y are considered vowels for this module.</b> Otherwise, they’re not.</p>

                <p class="highlightable">2. If the bomb was generated between 8AM-10AM, <b>all conditions that relate <i>only</i> to
                        ports or port types will return false no matter what.</b> Port plates is a different category,
                        and therefore will remain unaffected.</p>
                <p class="highlightable">3. If the serial number contains either an X or a Z, <b>the words “odd” and “even”
                        must be switched around in both manuals.</b></p>
                <p class="highlightable">4. If the bomb has more than 30 solvable modules, <b>the words “add” and
                        “subtract” must be switched around in both manuals.</b>
                        <i>(“Plus” and “minus” will remain unchanged.)</i></p>
                <p class="highlightable">5. If the bomb was generated between 00:10AM-11:49PM of <u>April 1st</u>,
                        <b><u>DO NOT flip the switch</u></b>. Instead, use the “Next” button to submit your answer

                <br>
                <h3>Flipping the Switch</h3>

                <p>Once you have gone through each set of instructions, the module will tell you to
                        flip the switch down. Once you do that, the display will cycle through a set of keywords.
                        Flip the switch back up when a valid keyword is on the screen to
                        disarm the module. Flipping the switch down before the module tells you to will skip right to
                        the keyword submission phase, but will not register a strike. However, like when the “Previous” button
                        is pressed, keywords may appear partially or totally glitched.</p>

                <p>Flipping the switch back up when an invalid keyword is showing, however, will
                        register a strike and return to the first set of instructions. A strike may or may not change
                        the sets of instructions previously displayed.</p>

                <p>Use the table below to identify which keywords are valid:</p>
