                            <li>The module shows a stage counter, a colour indicator and ten flashing lights with corresponding buttons.</li>
                            <li>The lights will flash in one of ten colours (see the below table). An initial will confirm the colour for both the light and the colour indicator.</li>
                            <li>On solving each module*, a 3-5 note sequence will flash, a colour will be displayed on the indicator and the solve counter will increase by one.</li>
                            <li><span class='bold'>Take note of the sequence and the colour of the indicator.</span></li>
                            <li>When <cite>Simon’s Stages</cite> is the last solvable module, the solve counter will go blank and the indicator will emit a steady blink.</li>
