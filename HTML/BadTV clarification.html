                    Hey guys, Speakingevil here. Oh my goodness guys, my stomach is rolling from eating that onion and rotten garlics, oh my goodness.

                    But uhh look guys look, its one of my greatest achievement: Bamboozled Again on the Fang’s 47. Hahaha.
                    Look guys look, the Vanilla Swirls: ultimate classic modpack. Um guys, you remember TVAB? Incredible. Incredible.
                    Ow my goodness guys, my stomach guys, my stomach. The bathroom is not far away. Oh my gosh, I’ve got to get to the door.
                    Aah-I just need to get to the door. Bye guys, bye. Don’t forget to subscribe. And the next module will be with me using the toilet.
                    Oh my goodness, guys. Aaaah! I need to get to the bathroom! It’s coming! It’s coming! AAAAAAAH!</span>
                </p>
                <ul>
                    <li>The module will activate after the first module on the bomb has been solved.<br>If there are no other modules, it will activate immediately.</li>
                    <li>Once active, the module will generate stages to be completed in a limited amount of time.</li>
                    <li>Failure to complete the stage in time will result in the loss of a life.</li>
                    <li><strong>If you run out of lives, literally the entire game (KTaNE) will forcibly exit.</strong> You do have enough time when the losing animation starts to go back to the office to prevent the game from exiting.</li>
                </ul>
                <p>It is essential that the defuser be equipped with a keyboard and use the arrow keys and space bar to directly interact with the module.</p>
                <p>For more details on how to complete each stage, find the on-screen prompt within Table A.</p>

                <h2>Boss Stage</h2>
                <p>Once enough stages have been completed, the module will enter the Boss Stage.<br>
                The Boss Stage will continue until it is either beaten (solving the module) or you run out of lives.</p>  
                <p>To complete the Boss Stage, you must manually trigger the bomb that ordinarily goes off after a certain amount of time.<br>To do this, you can move left and right with their respective arrows, jump and double-jump with the up arrow, and fire your weapon in the direction you’re facing by holding down the centre button.</p>
                <p>Firing at the bomb will weaken its stability. Once low enough, it will explode.<br>However, the bomb is not defenseless, colliding with it or any of its attacks will cost you a life. The more unstable the bomb is, the faster it will attack.</p>
                <p>There are a variety of attacks the bomb can perform, all of which have a tell.<br>Some can only be done with low enough stability.<br>Table B shows what attack the bomb will do for a given tell.</p>

                    <tr><td>Reeling back fist</td><td>Charges and throws a screen-spanning punch.<br>This attack can be performed multiple times in a row in quick succession.</td></tr>
                    <tr><td>Raising a foot</td><td>Launches itself at a 45&deg; angle, bouncing off the bounds of the screen.<br>After enough bounces, it will launch vertically, turning into a bulletproof statue at the apex of its jump.<br>The statue creates shockwaves when it lands.</td></tr>
                    <tr><td>Holding out bomb</td><td>Throws a large bomb at you that bounces several times. After each bounce, the bomb locks on to your current location.<br>This attack can be performed multiple times in a row in quick succession.</td></tr>
                    <tr><td>Jumping off‑screen</td><td>Drops smaller bombs down from the top of the screen which explode on the ground.<br>Larger bombs produce shockwaves when they land.<br>Eventually, the bomb will stop dropping smaller bombs and charge and throw a screen-spanning punch down from directly above you, creating multiple shockwaves when it lands.</td></tr>
