                <h2>On the Subject of The Green Wire</h2>
                <p class="flavour-text">Hold on- this doesn’t look right.</p>

                <p><em><i><strong>Note:</strong> If the module does NOT have a green wire <strong>or</strong> has a shorter wire base on the left side, you are looking at the wrong manual.</i></em></p>
                
                <p>A “The Green Wire” module has six plugs on each side of the module, each of which can have a wire in it. There are always 3-6 wires with only one being colored green.</p>
                <p><em><i>ALL</i></em> wires need to be cut to disarm the module.
                <p><strong>Wire ordering</strong> begins with the top-most wire as first, the wire below that as second, and so on. <i>Empty plug pairs are not counted in this order.</i></p>
                <p><strong>Plug ordering</strong> begins with the highest plugs on both sides as the first, the second-highest plugs on both sides as the second, and so on, going down.</p>
                <p>If an instruction tells you to cut a wire that is not there or has already been cut, you may safely skip over it.</p>
