                <h2>On the Subject of REP<span class="seq">SEQ</span></h2>
                <p class="flavour-text">Alright wise-guy, here's the last game.<br>Just follow my lead.</p>

                <p>When the bomb activates, this module will play some music, and some text will appear, moving in time with the music.</p>
                <p>For the first 16 beats (at 118 BPM), your <b>goal score</b> will be displayed, and will never appear again afterwards.</p>
                <p>After 64 beats play, the <span class="seq">seq</span>uences will begin.</p>
                <p>Each full <span class="seq">seq</span>uence consists of four parts: Flash 1, Input 1, Flash 2, and Input 2, in that order. Each one is approximately 4 seconds long, for a full length of 16 seconds.</p>
                <p>For each <i>Input</i> <span class="seq">seq</span>uence, press buttons according to the <i>Flash</i> <span class="seq">seq</span>uence that appeared just before. The beginning of an Input <span class="seq">seq</span>uence is indicated by all nine buttons flashing simultaneously.</p>
                <p>Be careful, as different full <span class="seq">seq</span>uences pull different tricks to make it harder to replicate. The full <span class="seq">seq</span>uence is determined by your <b>total score</b> at the start of the full <span class="seq">seq</span>uence.</p>
                <p>After every 4 full <span class="seq">seq</span>uences that play <i>with music,</i> you will get a 32-second break, during which your <b>total score</b> will be shown, and no <span class="seq">seq</span>uences will play.</p>
                <p>If you make no inputs during the second half of a full <span class="seq">seq</span>uence, the next one will play without music, and will also be ignored when determining when another break is to be given. This will not occur if a break is supposed to occur next.</p>
                <p>If, at the end of a full <span class="seq">seq</span>uence, your <b>total score</b> is greater than your <b>goal score</b>, the module will show your statistics, and then solve.</p>
                <p>A PERFECT bonus is awarded if every input during an Input <span class="seq">seq</span>uence matches what flashed, and no extra inputs are made.</p>
                <p>Your total score is calculated using the following formula:</p>
                <h4>(correct presses*2) - (incorrect presses) + (on-beat inputs) + (PERFECT <span class="seq">seq</span>uences*20) - (extra inputs*4)</h4>
                <p>This module will never strike.</p>

                <ol>
                 <li>Basic flashing, no tricks.</li>
                 <li>Similar to <span class="seq">seq</span>uence 1, but with extra flashes. Don't let it throw you off.</li>
                 <li>Basic movement. If the button expands slightly, press the center button. IGNORE when it expands immediately before Flash 2, it is only a diversion.</li>
                 <li>More movement, with slightly trickier timings.</li>
                 <li>Repeating <span class="seq">seq</span>uence 1 in every way.</li>
                 <li>The buttons will rotate during the Flash <span class="seq">seq</span>uences, 8 consistent 45° rotations in total. Inputs should be mapped to where the flashing button ends up at the end.</li>
                 <li>Everything EXCEPT the correct button will flash.</li>
                 <li>Combines <span class="seq">seq</span>uences 6 and 7, inverting flashes while also rotating the buttons.</li>
                 <li>Another repeat, this time of <span class="seq">seq</span>uence 3. Nothing unusual will occur.</li>
                 <li>The buttons will rotate more times, and with much less consistent timings. Pay very close attention, and don't get lost.</li>
