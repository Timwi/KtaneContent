                <h2>Appendix: Chinese Strokes</h2>
                <p>CJK strokes are the calligraphic strokes needed to write the Chinese characters in regular script used in East Asian calligraphy. CJK strokes are the classified set of line patterns that may be arranged and combined to form Chinese characters (also known as Hanzi) in use in China, Japan, and Korea. </p>
                <h3>Direction</h3>
                <p>All strokes have direction. They are unidirectional and start from one entry point. People should not write them in the reverse direction.  Here are some examples:</p>

                <h3>Type</h3>
                <p>A basic stroke is a single calligraphic mark moving in one direction across a writing surface. The following table lists a selection of basic strokes divided into two stroke groups: simple and combining. "Simple strokes" (such as Horizontal / Héng and Dot / Diǎn) can be written alone. "Combining strokes" (such as Zig / Zhé and J hook / Gōu) never occur alone, but must be paired with at least one other stroke forming a compound stroke. Thus, they are not in themselves individual strokes.</p>

                Note, the basic stroke Diǎn "Dot" is rarely a real dot. Instead it usually takes the shape of a very small line pointing in one of several directions, and may be long enough to be confused with other strokes.

                <h3>Compound strokes</h3>
                <p>A compound stroke (also called a complex stroke) is produced when two or more basic strokes are combined in a single stroke written without lifting the writing instrument from the writing surface. The character 永 (pinyin: yǒng) "eternity" described in more detail below demonstrates one of these compound strokes. The centre line is a compound stroke that combines three stroke shapes in a single stroke.</p>
                <h4>Basic for making compound strokes</h4>
                <p>In most cases, concatenating basic strokes together form a compound stroke. For example, Vertical / Shù combined with J hook / Gōu produce <img src="img/Chinese Strokes/3/Cjk k str vj.svg" class="smallicon"/> (Vertical – J hook / Shù Gōu). A stroke naming convention sums the names of the basic strokes, in the writing order.</p>
                <p>An exception to this applies when a stroke makes a turn of 90° (and only of 90°) in the Simplified Chinese names. Horizontal <img src="img/Chinese Strokes/3/Cjk k str h.svg" class="smallicon"/>(Héng) and Vertical <img src="img/Chinese Strokes/3/Cjk k str v.svg" class="smallicon"/> (Shù) strokes are identified only once when they appear as the first stroke of a compound; any single stroke with successive 90° turns down or to the right are indicated by a Zag 折 (pinyin: Zhé) "Break". For example, an initial Shù followed by an abrupt turn right produces <img src="img/Chinese Strokes/3/Cjk k str vh.svg" class="smallicon"/> (Shù Zhé). In the same way, an initial Shù followed by an abrupt turn right followed by a second turn down produces <img src="img/Chinese Strokes/3/Cjk k str vhv.svg" class="smallicon"/> (Shù Zhé Zhé). However, their inherited names are "Vertical – Horizontal" and "Vertical – Horizontal – Vertical". We need not to use "Zag" in the inherited names.</p>
                <p>Nearly all complex strokes can be named using this simple scheme.</p>
