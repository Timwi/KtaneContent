                <h2>On the Subject of Planet X</h2>
                <p class="flavour-text">In January 2016, Konstantin Batygin and Michael E. Brown published their “Planet Nine” hypothesis, using a computer model to show that a distant planet could explain the unique orbits of observable objects in the solar system.</p>
                <ul><li>Submit the sector that contains Planet X to disarm the module.</li></ul>
                <p>
                    The solar system is comprised of 12 sectors, a sun in the middle with the sectors going around it like a clock. Each sector can only hold 1 object. The table below will show you each type of object
                    that can show up in a sector, how many of them are in the solar system, as well as the rules that each object follows:

                <p>You can cycle through the sectors using the up/down arrow buttons in the top right. Some of the sectors can give you some information about what is/isn't contained in it via the screen to right. An object type with an X through it means that it doesn't contain that object type.</p>  
                <p>The bottom part of the module will display notes which you can cycle them using the arrows at the bottom. Each of the screens are labeled with the letter above it. Use the letter on screen A to determine the note type:</p>

                <p>Even though it is possible to solve the puzzle with all the information given to you, the KTaNE space program gives you a tool to help you solve the puzzle without trial-and-error. The reveal sector button will reveal the object type at the currently displayed sector. The screen to the right will update to give you what is located at that sector. However, you can only use this feature 4 times so use it wisely!</p>
