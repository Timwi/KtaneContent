                <p class="flavour-text">
                    This looks like one of those modules where you execute a set of commands in a weird programming language, except this one is a knocko-<br>
                    Well, the B-machine predates Brainf*** by 40 or so years, so I guess the other one is a knockoff.
                </p>

                <p>The module has a display and two buttons, one of which is marked and one is not.</p>
                <p>Every minute, a command from Hao Wang’s B-machine will be sent to the module, announced by a cowbell. This continues until half the bomb’s time in minutes have passed. A guide to the B-machine’s commands can be found below.</p>
                <p>After this happens, the module will be ready for input. Enter the state of the portion of the tape that has been visited using the buttons to solve the module. Entering an incorrect state will strike and clear your input.</p>

                <h3>A Guide To The B-Machine</h3>
                <p>The B-machine is a simple computational model created by Hao Wang. It uses an infinite tape made up of cells, which can be marked or unmarked, to store information and reads that information using a scanning head. Below are all the commands it uses.</p><ul>
                    <li> →: Move the scanning head one cell to the right, then continue to the next instruction.</li>
                    <li> ←: Move the scanning head one cell to the left, then continue to the next instruction.</li>
                    <li> *: Mark the cell under the scanning head, then continue to the next instruction.</li>
                    <li> Cn: If the cell under the scanning head is marked, go to the Nth instruction. Otherwise, continue to the next instruction. Unlike in the actual B-machine, this jump can only be executed a maximum of five times.</li>
                </ul>
