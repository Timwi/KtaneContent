                    <p>This needy module has a display with 7 flowers that will randomly have a color every time it gets activated.</p>
					<p>The colors in order should be blue, green, indigo, orange, red, violet, yellow.</p>
					<p>It also has a letter with a color that will also change whenever the needy is activated.</p>
					<p>The display in the module will have either a day or a night scene and it changes every needy activation.</p>
                    <p>You will have 30 seconds to input a specific flower color.</p>
					<p>A strike will occur whenever the defuser inputs the wrong color.</p>
					<p>To cycle through the colors simply click on the flower field and they will change their colors.</p>
					<h3>Solving the needy</h3>
                    <ul>
                        <li>The defuser must submit either the color of the letter or the color that has it's first letter as the displayed one.</li>
                        <li>

                                <li>And the last digit of the serial number is even, then the submission should be the color of the letter in the display.</li>
                                <li>Else the submission should be the color that has the same first letter as the letter display.</li>
                            </ul>
                        </li>

                                <li>And the last digit of the serial number is even, then the submission should be the color that has the same first letter as the letter in the display.</li>
                                <li>Else the submission should be the color of the letter in the display.</li>
