                        There are five safe squares in row 9 and three safe squares in row 10. The unsafe squares will, at some point, flash white. Each unsafe square
                        will flash two times within each minute of the bomb timer with the exception of the first minute.
                    </li>
                    <li>There will only be one set of vertically-adjacent squares in rows 9 and 10 that are safe.</li>
