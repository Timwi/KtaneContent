                <h2>On the Subject of Pigfair Cipher</h2>
                <p class="flavour-text">Alternatively, this can be called Playpen Cipher, but isn’t that a box that children play in?</p>
                <p>A Pigfair Cipher has two screens, a keyboard, a red delete button, and a green submit button.</p>
                <p>First, create your Playfair matrix. Start by taking the serial number characters in order, converting any numbers into their alphabetic position. In the case of 0, use 10. Remove any duplicate letters except for the first, as well as any occurrences of the letter X.</p>
                <p>Then, take the rest of the alphabet without the letter X and any letters in the string created earlier, and place it before or after the string. If there are an even number of batteries, place the alphabet after the string. Otherwise, place the alphabet before the string.</p>
                <p>Each image on the top screen corresponds to a position in the Playfair matrix. Refer to the image at the bottom of the page. Take these letters and split them up into pairs.</p>
                <ul>
                    <li>If the two letters are the same, keep them as is.</li>
                    <li>Otherwise, if the two letters are in the same row of your matrix, replace them with the letters to their left respectively, wrapping around to the right side of the row if necessary.</li>
                    <li>Otherwise, if the two letters are in the same column of your matrix, replace them with the letters immediately above, wrapping around to the bottom of the column if necessary.</li>
                    <li>Otherwise, replace each letter with the letter on the same row, but in the column of the other letter in the original pair.</li>
                </ul>
                <p>Once you have decrypted the Playfair, you should get an 8-letter word. Submit your answer by typing it in with the keyboard and pressing the green submit button. Inputting a wrong answer will incur a strike. Inputting the correct answer will solve the module.</p>
