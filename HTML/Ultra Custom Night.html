                <p>An Ultra Custom Night module will initially present you with a list of animatronics. These
                    animatronics can be enabled or disabled at will. An enabled one will be green, and a disabled one
                    black. Some will be red, and will automatically be enabled. Choose animatronics such that their
                    diffiulty rating totals to at least 20. If fewer are chosen, the module will choose randomly until
                    this condition is met. Start the module by solving any other module. The enabled animatronics will
                    begin to attack until the module is solved. The module will automatically solve when every other
                    <a href="../More/Ignore%20Table.html#mod=ultraCustomNight">non-ignored module</a> is solved. Good luck.</p>

                <h5>Cameras:</h5>
                <p>Use the square buttons on the screen to switch between camera views. Press a round door button to
                    close that door. Only one door may be closed at a time.</p>
                <h5>Vents:</h5>
                <p>Use the square buttons on the screen to switch between vent views. Press a round seal button to seal
                    that vent. Only one vent may be sealed at a time.</p>

                        will have fifteen seconds to <strong>turn on</strong> the alarm clock to stop him from

                        more you look at his camera. Once he is completely gone, you will only have a short amount of

                        (Vent 8 is above cam 1 and vent 9 is above cam 2.) He will then proceed to move the shortest
                        path to your office. Make sure the correct vent is sealed to stop him. Toy Freddy is silent.</p>

                        exactly thirty seconds before she attacks. Her attack will fail if you are not holding the bomb.

                <h3>Additional Notes</h3>
                <ul>
                    <li>Only one animatronic will ever attack at a time. If nothing is happening, that means someone is
                        currently attacking!</li>
                    <li>There are six exceptions to the above rule: Golden Freddy, Nightmare BB, Funtime Foxy, The
                        Puppet, BB, and JJ can all attack
                        at any time.</li>
                    <li>Some animatronics will be forced to be inactive if certain conditions are met.</li>
                    <li>BB and JJ will only attack modded modules.</li>
                    <li>If you have more than 20 Difficulty Rating selected, the animatronics will attack
                        <strong>faster</strong>.
                    </li>
                    <li>Something special might happen if every animatronic is active at once...</li>
