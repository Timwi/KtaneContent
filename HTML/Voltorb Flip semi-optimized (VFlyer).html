                <h2>Unflipping The Voltorbs</h2>
                <p class="flavour-text">Don’t you just love it when things just flip?</p>

                <p>Refer to the original manual <a href="Voltorb%20Flip.html">here</a> for the original instructions.</p>
                <p>To disarm the module, flip the safe tiles to reveal all of the 2s and 3s that are hidden in the module. Flipping over a Voltorb, which is an unsafe tile, will give you a strike.</p>

                <p>On the bottom of each column and to the right of each row,
                there are numbers that give hints about the tiles in the respective row or column.
                The top number is the sum of the numbers of the numbered tiles in the row or column,
                and the bottom number is the amount of unsafe tiles in that row or column.</p>

                <p>On the right of the module is a toggleable button.
                Pressing this button will change the label to “Marking” and the module will enter Marking Mode.
                Pressing it again will change it back to “Flipping” and will exit Marking Mode.</p>

                <p>While in Marking Mode, clicking on a tile will not flip it over,
                but instead leave a mark on it. Clicking on marked tiles will remove the mark.
                You can use this to mark tiles that might be dangerous.
                Marking a tile will <strong>NOT</strong> prevent it from being flipped once you leave Marking Mode.</p>

                <p><strong>The module will almost certainly generate a situation where you will need the following.</strong></p>
                <p>Exactly 2 tiles are always unsafe.
                Assume that all the tiles are numbered 1–25, starting with the top-left tile being 1 and the numbers proceed in reading order.</p>

                <p>Take all the numbers and letters from the serial number and add them together.
                Treat each letter as its position in the alphabet (A=1, Z=26).
                Keep the sum within 1–25 by repeatedly subtracting 25 to your sum. This corresponds to the first tile that when flipped will ALWAYS strike you.</p>
                <p>Take all of the ports that are present. Starting with 0, add the number on the right based on each present port.
                This sum, after being kept within 1 - 25 inclusive by repeatedly subtracting 25 to your sum, will be the second tile that will always strike you if it’s flipped. If tile is in the same position as another calculated tile, use the next tile in reading order instead, wrapping to the top left if necessary.</p>
