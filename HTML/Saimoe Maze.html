                <p class="flavour-text">Cruelest Cruel of Cruels.</p>
                <p>The module consists of a small gray button surrounded by larger buttons. There are also 2 buttons with images shown. This will be the indicator of your position on the maze. The top-left corner of the maze is marked as <b>Row 1 - Column 1</b>.</p>
                <p>You are currently placed in a random position on the maze. To locate your current position on the maze, locate the cell position of the image that is in white color. Treat this as your row number. Then, locate the cell position of the image that is in black color. Treat this as your column number. Locate the intersection of the two numbers. The intersected cell position is your current position on the maze.</p>
                <p>You must travel from your current position to your end position. To locate your end position, locate the first number in your <b>Serial Number</b>. Add one to that number. Treat this as your column. Then, convert all the characters of the <b>Serial Number</b> into numbers <b>[0 -> 9  /  A (10) -> Z (35)]</b>. Add all of the numbers together. Modulo that number by 14. Then add one to that number. Treat this as your column. Move until you reach the end position. Moving on a wall will give you a strike.</p>
                <p><b>The gray button in the center of the module has 2 functions:</b></p>
                <ul>
                <li>If you hold the button for 1 second or longer, the module will perform a reset on your maze position. This will take about <b>10-15 seconds</b>. After that, the module give you 2 new images. This will be your new starting position.</li>
                <li>If you did not hold the button for at least one second, the module will scan your position. If you are not standing in the end position, the module will strike you. If you are standing in the end position, the module will solve.</li>
