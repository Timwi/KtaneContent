                <p>You have your target’s address narrowed down to 16 neighborhoods. The
                missile starts aimed at a random neighborhood in that area, which varies
                from module to module.</p>

                <p>When determining what neighborhood to aim at, the targeting system runs a simulation of a series of air strikes. In the table below, each cell whose
                    condition is true will get hit by a missile. When the missile explodes, it hits <u>the cell where it landed, and every cell in its row and column</u>. Once
                    the simulation is complete, there will be exactly one cell that was not hit by any explosions. The location of that cell is where the missile will be
                    aimed when the module initializes.</p>

                <p>Next, you need to aim the missile at your target. The arrows on the module
                will move your crosshair in their respective directions, and if you go off
                of the 4&times;4 grid, you will loop around to the other side.</p>
                <p>To determine which neighborhood to launch the missile at, look at the
                message your target sent. Depending on the topic and the stance they took,
                you can determine where they live. Use the “For” column if their message is
                in favor of the topic, or the “Against” column if their message goes against
                the topic.</p>
