                    <ul class="system outer">
                        <li>This module consists 4 states based on the original Ultimate Custom Night game: Cameras, Vent system, Duct system and Perks.</li>
                        <li>You can switch between them using the buttons on the left.</li>
                        <li>After every other non-ignored module on the bomb is solved, the module will automatically disarm.</li>
                    </ul>

                    <h1>Camera system</h1>
                    <ul class="system outer">
                        <li>Every time you solve a module the vacuum cleaner (Mr. Hugs) will move to another camera. Your job is to find him and close the door below that camera</li>
                        <li><span style="font-style: italic">One door can be closed at a time.</span></li>
                        <li>If you solve a module and that door isn’t closed you’ll get a strike.</li>
                    </ul>

                    <h1>Vent system</h1>
                    <ul class="system outer">
                        <li>Two animatronics are in the vent. Mangle is the white fox; Withered Chica is the duck.</li>
                        <li>There are 3 routes which they can move on. Your job is to snare that route with the light squares on the end of them before they get through it.</li>
                        <li><span style="font-style: italic">One snare can be active at a time.</span></li>
                        <li>Withered chica always goes on the right route, but Mangle always goes on a random route.</li>
                        <li>If any of them gets to the end of the route you’ll get a strike. (And the animatronic will go to the start again)</li>
                        <li>You can also prevent them from getting into your office by closing the front vent door by pressing "W" (this consumes power)</li>
                    </ul>

                    <h1>Duct system</h1>
                    <ul class="outer">
                        <li>Two animatronics are in the duct. (Pink is Pigpatch; Purple is Mr. Hippo). Your job is to prevent them from reaching the end.</li>
                        <li>They can only get through the duct that is open :P</li>
                        <li>Press the "Open Duct" button that is lit to open that duct and close the other!</li>
                        <li>You can place audio lure in every corner to lure the animatronics there.</li>
                        <li><span style="font-style: italic">Audio lure can be only in 1 corner at a time.</span></li>
                        <li>If any of them reaches the open end of the duct you’ll get a strike.</li>
                    </ul>
                    <span style="font-style: italic">Note: </span>You don’t see the power nor can change the music while the duct system is selected!

                        <li>Perks are small utilities that help you get through the night.</li>

                        <li>When attacking, Afton will make a rattling noise and the lights'll start flashing in the room.</li>
                        <li>Quickly close the side vent door by pressing "F" to prevent him from striking! (Keeping it on consumes power)</li>
                        <li>Afton won't attack more than one time per UCN module</li>

                        <li>Chica is constantly making noise with pots and pans in the kitchen.</li>
                        <li>However, she might get bored of the music playing. If you hear her noise stop, you have a short time to click on the Change Music button before she gets mad at you and strikes.</li>
                        <li>Changing the music before her noise stops will cause a strike.</li>
                        <li>Alternatively, you can turn on the Global Music Box perk. While it’s active, Chica won't stop her noise. However, it consumes power.</li>
                    </ul>
                    <h1>Power management</h1>
                    <ul class="outer">
                        <li>You can see the available power and current consumption on the bottom-right corner of the module (except on duct state)</li>
                        <li>If there’s a consumption (bar after "Usage:") the available power starts decreasing with its speed depending on the consumption.</li>
                        <li>If the power counter reaches 0, the bomb will detonate instantly.</li>
