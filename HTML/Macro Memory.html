            <ul><li>One of the present modules will activate, showing a number in the display.</li>
            <li>Use the displayed digit to determine the correct button, which may be on any module, and press it to advance the stage of the active module.</li>
            <li>Complete all stages of a module to disarm it. A disarmed module may not activate again. However, a button on a disarmed module may be the correct button to press.</li>
            <li>Correct presses are commited to the memory of each present module. Incorrect presses reset all unsolved modules to stage 1 and clear their memory of previous activations.</li></ul>
