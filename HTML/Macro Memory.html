                <p class="flavour-text">Memory is... uh... mem- memory is fra.. fragrant? No, fragile. Memory is fragile and... where was I again? Oh yes, always pay attention.</p>
                <ul>
                    <li>One of the present modules will activate, showing a number in the display.</li>
                    <li>Use the displayed digit to determine the correct button, which may be on any module, and press it to advance the stage of the active module.</li>
                    <li>Complete all stages of a module to disarm it. A disarmed module may not activate again. However, a button on a disarmed module may be the correct button to press.</li>
                    <li>Correct presses are committed to the memory of each present module. Incorrect presses reset all unsolved modules to stage 1 and clear their memory of previous activations.</li>
                    <li>Solved modules will still generate pressable buttons.</li>
