                    Usually in poker, the wrong call means losing a lot of money. Here, it means death.
                </p>

                <p><i>SEE APPENDIX PK71 FOR POKER HAND RANKINGS.</i></p>

                <div class='compact'>
                    <p>The module will display a single face-up card.
                    <p>You must push two of the buttons and one of the face-down cards in order to disarm it.
                    <p>Use the given card to determine which of the four flow charts you should use.
                    <p>Use the flow charts to determine your 5-card poker hand and press the appropriate button.
                    <p>Your opponent will then respond. Use the two-way table to determine whether the response is the "truth" or a "bluff".
                    <p>Your opponent will then make a bet. Use the betting rules to determine which of the four final cards you should press.
