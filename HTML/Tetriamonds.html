                    <p>This module will display six triangles in the shape of a hexagon. The triangles will not flash, but they will move out from the center and return when the sequence finishes. This will be referred to as a pulse. Triangles will also either face left or right. The colours are: rose, orange, lime, jade, azure, violet and grey. In order to determine what triangles to press, follow the following rules.</p>

                    <h3>Determining colours</h3>
                    <p>Whenever you obtain four adjacent colours, you should continue to the next section. The order will not be determined by this step.</p>
					  <ol>
                        <li>Place the pulsed colours on the indicated positions in the graph.</li>
                        <li>If none of your pieces were grey, or the non-grey colours are adjacent, your colours are the colours that did not pulse.</li>
                        <li>If the three colours form a straight line on the graph, your colours are the received colours plus the first available colour clockwise on the module from the first received colour.</li>
                        <li>Otherwise, your colours are the colours that pulsed plus the colour opposite on the graph of the first non-grey piece.</li>
                    </ol>
                    <h3>Determining shape</h3>
                    <p>Only one rule applies every time.</p>
					  <ol>
                        <li>If all three pulsing triangles have the same orientation, construct a triangle.</li>
                        <li>If the first two pieces match in orientation, construct a rhomboid.</li>
                        <li>If both rules did not apply, construct a U-shape.</li>
                    </ol>
                    <h3>Determining order</h3>
                    <p>Always append colours at the end of your current list.</p>
					  <ol>
                        <li>Take all pulsing colours obtained in order.</li>
                        <li>Add the first not already taken colour clockwise from the first pulsing colour on the module and repeat this for the second an the third colour.</li>
                        <li>Add the remaining colour, which did not appear on the module.</li>
                    </ol>

				<h3>Determining orientation</h3>
                    <p>Use the graph based on the shape. For a U-shape look at the hexagonal graph, for a triangle at both the triangular graphs and for the rhomboid at the rhomboidal graph (which wraps around). If the shape is invalid, go to the section about invalid shapes. Otherwise continue to the next section.</p>
			      	<ol>
                        <li>Place your colours on the graph where possible.</li>
                        <li>Anything can be placed on grey.</li>
                        <li>Grey can be placed anywhere, as long as it helps you form a valid shape and there is only one option to make it valid. Grey prefers a grey position if possible. If there are two options without any preferred, and your shape is not a triangle, it's invalid.</li>
                        <li>If your shape can not be constructed with the given colours, it's invalid.</li>
                        <li>If your shape is a rhomboid, the direction is given by the module. The first two pulses give the direction in which your graph has to cycle.</li>
                    </ol>
					<h3>Submitting your tetriamond</h3>
					<h4>U-shape</h4>
                    <p>Press the triangles according to the shape and order you obtained.</p>
					<h4>Triangle</h4>
                    <p>Press the triangles according to the shape and order you obtained. Do not use a wraparound until impossible otherwise.</p>
					<h4>Rhomboid</h4>
                    <p>Press the triangles according to the shape and order you obtained. The wraparound should be in the middle cut.</p>
                <h4>Invalid shapes</h4>
                    <p>To make an invalid shape valid, remove the last non-grey colour in order from your shape, and replace it with the first available non-grey colour in order that does make it valid.</p>
