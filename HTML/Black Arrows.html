                <h2>On the Subject of Black Arrows</h2>
                <p class="flavour-text">Remember every twist and turn you take!</p>
                <p>If the arrows are not black, you are looking at a different module.</p>
                <p>
                    This module contains four black arrows, and a display in the middle. This display shows the stage number the module is on as well as 2 bars that slowly decrease, denoting how much buffered time is left for that stage. Each time a module*
                    is solved and while the buffer is empty, this stage number changes.
                </p>
                <p>
                    Find your starting location on the grid on the next page. Use the 3rd character of the serial number as the row, and the 6th as the column. Make note of the number on your starting location. At each stage, move in the indicated direction,
                    wrapping around the grid if necessary. Make note of every number you "visit."
                </p>
                <p>
                    Add the sum of the alphabetic positions of all letters in the serial number, mod 5, + n to each "visited" number, where n is the current stage number. (Consider the number from your initial position on the grid to be stage 0.) If you obtain
                    a number that is higher than 12, repeatedly subtract 12 until it isn't.
                </p>
                <p>
                    For each stage, the arrows on the module can flash in eight directions, in addition to flashing all four at once, which represents staying in place. 2 consecutive arrows flashing represent the combined direction to move in the grid. If
                    a set of arrow flashes multiple times before resting, repeat that movement based on how many times the arrow flashed before the rest and only note after the end of the movement.
                </p>
                <p>
                    When all other non-boss modules have been solved, the display will turn blank, and the module is ready for input. Attempting to interact with the module before this time will incur a strike. Convert every obtained number, including stage
                    0, to an arrow using the table below, and press those arrows in that order. An incorrect arrow press while the module is ready to submit will reveal the stage you inputted incorrectly as well as reshowing arrow directions up to the
                    stage that was struck on, if there are any.
