                <h2>On the Subject of Clearance Code</h2>
                <p class="flavour-text">You are nested with so much protection. Do you feel stressed out now?</p>
                <p>The module consists of 10 buttons numbered 0-9 in a circular position, and a display in the center of the buttons.</p>
                <p>In the beginning of the module, 4 buttons will light up.
                    Buttons that are lit up will have their texts in black and their buttons in white, and vice versa.
                    Starting from the top button and moving clockwise, create a 4 digit number using the digits in the lit buttons.
                    The first lit button will be the first digit, the second will be the second, etc.</p>
                <p>
                    After a <a href="../More/Ignore%20Table.html#mod=clearanceCodeModule">non-ignored</a> module is solved, the buttons will randomize their positions and all the lit buttons will turn off.
                    Locate the new positions of the digits that you gathered.
                    Moving clockwise, calculate the distance of their initial positions and their current positions.
                    Add the distances to their respective digits.
                    If the result goes over nine, use the least significant digit.
                    After that, type the code that was calculated.
                    If the code is correct, the lights beside the display will flash green, and you would be able to continue to solve modules without problem.
                    If the code is incorrect, or a non-ignored module was solved while this module is waiting for the correct code, the light beside the display will flash red and a strike will occur.
                    <strong>This stage must still be completed, otherwise more strikes will occur.</strong></p>
                <p>After inputting the first code correctly, a new set of 4 buttons will light up from the current arrangement of digits.
                    After obtaining the code from the current arrangement, use the same step that was performed in the beginning but instead of adding, you will subtract the digits you gathered from the code you calculated previously by each of their respective distances.
                    <strong>The distances will also be in the opposite direction.</strong>
                    If the number goes into negatives, keep adding ten until it turns into a positive number.</p>
                <p>Repeat the entire procedure until all the non-ignored modules have been solved. Inputting the code correctly one last time will disarm the module.</p>
                <p>If at any point this module strikes, the module will light up each pair of digits in color, one of which will be filled in and have black text, and the other will just be colored. If only one is colored, it will be paired by itself. Each pair of digits that light up in color correspond to the distance between the two, and the initial digit of the 4 digit number for this stage, if the digit was in black text.</p>
