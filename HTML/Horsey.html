                <p class="flavour-text">Yes, it's <span style="text-decoration: line-through;">another</span> Chess module.</p>
                On the module, there's a chess puzzle shown. The defuser has to make the best possible moves in order to solve the module (the puzzles might not go until checkmate).
                <h3>Basic Chess rules</h3>
                <p>Chess is a board game for 2 players consisting of a board with a 8x8 grid of cells and 6 different kinds of pieces (Pawn, Rook, Knight, Bishop, Queen, King) with dark or light colors in respect to the player they belong to. Each kind of piece has a different moveset and can capture a piece of the different color if collides with it. The goal is for the player to protect their king whilst trying to checkmate the other player's king (putting it in a position where it's impossible to defend it). When their king is in check (could be captured by the other player), they have to defend it in their turn by either moving it, taking down the piece that could capture it, or blocking the other player's piece's way with another piece. The player who gets checkmated loses.</p>
