                        <h2>On the Subject of Left and Right</h2>
                        <p class="flavour-text">Right is there where the thumb is left...</p>
                        
                        <p>A green button and a blue button. Left and Right. All you have to do is press those 2 buttons in the correct sequence.</p>

                        <h3>Determining the correct sequence</h3>
						<p>To determine the correct sequence you have to create a 3-5 digit number using the following rules:
						<ul>
							<li>The first number is the last digit of the serial number cubed % 8</li>
							<li>If there are more or less ports than there are port plates, the next number is the number of ports plus the number of port plates, power 4 % 4</li>
							<li>Otherwise the next 2 numbers are the number of ports, followed by the number of port plates</li>
							<li>If there are the same amount of batteries as there are battery holders, the next number is the number of batteries plus the number of battery holders, squared % 6</li>
							<li>Otherwise the next 2 numbers are the number of batteries, followed by the number of battery holders</li>
						</ul>
						<p>After you determined your number you have to convert it to base 2. This new number is your sequence, where every 1 represents the right button and every 0 represents the left button.</p>
						<h3>The plot twist</h3>
						<p style="padding-bottom: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">After each button has been pressed a number of times, left and right switch, but the buttons stay physically the same. So you need to reorganize your found sequence according to the switch.</p>
						<h3 style="padding-top: 0; margin-top: 0.5em;">Determining the switch</h3>
						<p>Look through the following list to find out the number of presses it takes on a given button to perform a switch. The first found correct statement determines the switch for the blue button, the second found correct statement for the green button.</p>
						<ul>
							<li>More lit than unlit indicators: 3</li>
							<li>A vowel in the serial number: 2</li>
							<li>Battery holders + port plates + indicators &lt;= 5: 4</li>
							<li>At least 5 modules on the bomb: 1</li>
							<li>Numbers in S# equal to letters in S#: 2</li>
							<li>None of the above: 3</li>
							<li>Special rule - Lit FRK, unlit NSA, P/S2 port, parallel port, serial port, RJ-45 port, DVI-D port present and RCA port not present: No switches occur</li>
						</ul>
