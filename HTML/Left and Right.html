                <h2>On the Subject of Left and Right</h2>
                <p class="flavour-text">Right is where the thumb is left...</p>

                <p>A green button and a blue button. Left and Right. All you have to do is press those 2 buttons in the correct sequence. Green and blue can either be left or right.</p>

                <h3>Determining the correct sequence</h3>
                <p>To determine the correct sequence, construct a number consisting of several digits using the following rules:</p>
                <ul>
                    <li>The first digit is the last digit of the serial number, cubed, % 8.</li>
                    <li>If there are more or fewer ports than there are port plates, the next digit is the number of ports plus the number of port plates, to the power of 4, % 4.</li>
                    <li>Otherwise the next digit(s) are the number of D batteries, followed by the number of letters in the serial number.</li>
                    <li>If the number of batteries equals the number of battery holders, the next digit is the number of lit minus unlit indicators, squared, % 6.</li>
                    <li>Otherwise the next digit(s) are the sum of batteries plus battery holders.</li>
                </ul>
                <p>Finally, convert this number to base 2. This new number is your sequence. A digit 1 represents the right button and a 0 represents the left button. An incorrect input will result in a strike, but it will not reset the module.</p>
                <h3>The plot twist</h3>
                <p>Whenever a button has been pressed a number of times, left and right switch, but the buttons stay physically the same. So you need to reorganize your found sequence according to the switches.</p>
                <p>Look through the following list to find the number of presses of a given button after which a switch occurs. The first found correct statement determines the switch for the green button, the second found correct statement for the blue button.</p>
                <ul>
                    <li>More lit than unlit indicators: 3</li>
                    <li>A vowel in the serial number: 2</li>
                    <li>Battery holders + port plates + indicators ≤ 5: 4</li>
                    <li>At least 5 modules on the bomb: 1</li>
                    <li>Numbers in S# equal to letters in S#: 2</li>
                    <li>None of the above: 3</li>
                    <li>Special rule - Lit FRK, unlit NSA, PS/2 port, parallel port, serial port, RJ-45 port, DVI-D port present and RCA port not present: No switches occur</li>
                </ul>
