                <h2>On the Subject of Spiderman 2004s</h2>
                <p class="flavour-text">Spider-Man 2 is a 2004 action-adventure video game, based on the film of the same name. Published by Activision, the console versions were developed by Treyarch, while the others had different developers and are drastically different as a result. The game is the sequel to Spider-Man (2002), itself based on the film of the same name. The Treyarch-developed versions are considered a landmark title in the industry for being the first superhero video game to incorporate a full open world design.</p>

                <ul>
