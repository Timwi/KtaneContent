                <h2>On the Subject of Spilling Paint</h2>
                <p class="flavour-text">Where two wrongs make a right.</p>

                <p>On the module is a 6×6 grid of cells, a color selector, and a reset button.</p>

                <p>In order to solve the module, turn every cell white in exactly 7 spills. If any cell is not white after 7 spills, or you press the reset button, the module will return to its original state.</p>

                <p>Each color is assigned a value between 0 and 6, where white is 0, red is 1, orange is 2, yellow is 3, green is 4, blue is 5, and purple is 6.</p>

                <p>In order to spill paint on the module, select the color of your choice from the selector, then press a cell on the module. When paint spills, the following occurs:</p>
                <ul>
                    <li>Paint will be applied to the pressed cell, as well as every adjacent cell, both orthogonally and diagonally.
                        <ul>
                            <li>The grid does not wrap around, so a spill in the top left corner only affects 4 cells.</li>
                        </ul>
                    </li>
                    <li>The new color of a cell is calculated by summing the numerical value of both the current cell color and the color of the paint spilled, subtracting 7 if the total is greater than 6, and converting this value back into a color.</li>
                </ul>
