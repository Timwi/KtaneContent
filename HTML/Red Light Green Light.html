                <h2>On the Subject of Red Light Green Light</h2>
                <p class="flavour-text">I’m good at every module, except the ones I can’t do.</p>
                <p>Occasionally, the sound of the Korean phrase “무궁화 꽃 이 피었 습니다” being spoken can be heard. When this happens, the defuser only has a few seconds before the module turns around.</p>
                <p>After the module turns around, do not move. Moving the cursor at all, pressing any mouse button, or pressing any key counts as movement. Once the module turns back around, movement can be resumed. If movement is detected, the module will strike. The module can only strike once per activation.</p>
                <p>Once the module has activated a certain number of times, it will solve once the last activation has ended. The number of activations is the number of modules on the bomb divided by 5, rounded up. The module also solves upon an activation ending if every non-boss module on the bomb is solved.</p>
                <p>This module has a hard mode that can be activated in the settings. If hard mode is active, movement will automatically detonate the bomb, instead of striking once.</p>
                <p>Hard mode may automatically be active based on the mission on which this module can be found. Hard mode can be forced for a mission in a similar way to modules such as Bakery, Censorship, and IPA.</p>
