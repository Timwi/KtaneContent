                <h2>On the Subject of Vigilant Psycho</h2>
                <p class="flavour-text">Is the name misspelt this way to prepare for the wrath that is about to come?</p>
                <p>The module displays five letters on its upper screen.<br>Use the transformations corresponding to the colours of each letter in the table of page 2 to obtain the original sequence of letters.</p>
                <p><strong>When the module refers to alphabetic positions, it refers to the A1Z26 positions in the alphabet used on each stage. This alphabet will change upon switching stages.</strong></p>
                <p>Caesar shifting the first letter of the target word by the alphabetic positions of each letter in the original sequence one after another yields the other letters of the target word.</p>
                <p>Enter the target word into the module using the module's keyboard.<br><strong>The colour transformations also apply the letters that are entered.</strong></p>
                <p>Submitting the correct target word will advance the module to the next of three stages, scrambles the keyboard, and changes its colouring. If the submit button is pressed before 6 letters have been inputted, the submit button will do nothing instead.</p>
                <p>The red button can be pressed at any time to clear the entry. If the red button is pressed twice in a row while the entry is empty, or two consecutive strikes have occurred in later stages, the module will step back a stage, and require the previous stage to be completed again.</p>

                <p>Upon entering stage 3, a 15 minute timer will start ticking down. If the timer expires or a strike occurs on this stage, the module will forcibly step back to stage 2.</p>
                <p>After applying the original procedure, you will need to shift backwards by the alphabetic positions of each letter decoded from stage 2 to finally get a target word for this stage.</p>
                <p>The submit button will also glitch out, blinking in a series of red, green, and gray flashes.</p>
                <p>Pressing the submit button before inputting 6 letters will now cycle between the various colours that can be applied to each letter. Each colour must be used only once with the exception of 1 colour that should NOT be used in the solution at all. Refer to the next page to find the forbidden colour.</p>
                <p>In addition, one other letter MUST be inputted onto the module, BEFORE its transformation applies. The missing colour corresponding to the letter on the keyboard that only has 6 possible different colourings will correspond to ANY of the letters that should be inputted. All other letters on the keyboard will cycle through all 7 possible different colourings.</p>

                <p>From the colours flashed from the submit button, treat green and red flashes as binary digits 1 and 0 respectively. Treat a long gray flash as a separator between the last and first binary digits. Only 7 binary digits should be obtained this way.

                <p class="sh">When shifting the binary, treat the binary as a loop of 7 digits. Shifting the binary left means taking the first digits and placing them at the end; shifting the binary to the right means taking the last digits and placing them at the beginning.</p>
