                    <h2>On the Subject of Trying to Un-Ancient-Obvious-ify Partitions</h2>
                    <p class="flavour-text">Help.</p>

                    <p>This module displays a 5×5 grid of pixels. Highlighting a pixel will reveal its colour channels and its group number. In order to solve the module, you must group the current groups until there is just one left. Initially there are 25 groups, one for each pixel.</p>
                    <p>The groups all have three values between 0 and 4 inclusive. These are their RGB values. To get a group's value, add its three values together.</p>
                    <p>In order to obtain the grouping, repeat the following process until all groups are regrouped:</p>
                    <ol>
                        <li>Take the sum of all group values, this will be called <code>Sgv</code></li>
                        <li>Obtain <code>i = (Sgv % Gc) + 1</code>, where <code>Gc</code> is the amount of groups currently shown on the module</li>
                        <li>Take the value of the <code>i</code><sup>th</sup> group on the module (the group that shows <code>i</code> when highlighted). This value will be called <code>Gv</code></li>
                        <li>Obtain <code>Ngs = (Gv ⨬ Us) + 1</code>, where Us is the amount of ungrouped squares (25 for the first iteration of stage 1). <br> ⨬ is a custom operator, named “reductive-modulo”. It behaves as follows for <code>a ⨬ b</code></li>
                        <ul>
                            <li>If <code>a &lt; b</code>, return <code>a</code>.</li>
                            <li>Otherwise, do the following in order: <code>a = a - b</code>, <code>b = b - 1</code></li>
                            <li>Try step 1 again with your new <code>a</code> and <code>b</code></li>
                            <li>If <code>b = 0</code> before <code>a &lt; b</code>, return 0.</li>
                        </ul>
                        <li>Disregard the <code>i</code><sup>th</sup> current group for all steps, except for step 4. This means <code>Gc = Gc - 1</code>, <code>Us = Us - Ngs</code>, and <code>Sgv = Sgv - Gv</code>. <code>Ngs</code> is the size of one of the new groups.</li>
                    </ol>
                    <p>Note: The group count must always be reduced. If you only have groups of 1 in your regrouping, replace two of those by a group of 2.</p>
                    <p>To submit your groups, select an amount of pixels. Press a pixel, highlight until there are as many groups selected as required for a group, then press one of the selected pixels. These pixels will no longer be selectable for further groups and they will not reveal their colour again until a strike incurs or the module advances.</p>
                    <p>The shapes of these groups and the order of entering them does not matter.</p>
