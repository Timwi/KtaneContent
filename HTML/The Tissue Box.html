                <h2>On the Subject of The Tissue Box™</h2>
                <p class="flavour-text">Who knew that people with allergies would have better chances of defusing a bomb?</p>

                <p>The Tissue Box™ module displays a box of tissues. The box may be many various colors. The box will be a cube or a rectangular prism.</p>
                <p>
                    In order to solve the module, a specific amount of tissues must be pulled out of the box. Tissues are pulled out of the box by clicking on them.
                    The first click will begin a timer. Note that this timer is based on real seconds, not based on bomb ticks.
                    The specific amount of time that elapses, and the correct amount of tissues to pull, can be determined by using the formulas on the second page of this manual.
                </p>
                <p>
                    Once the module timer reaches zero, one of two events will occur.
                    If the amount of tissues pulled out of The Tissue Box™ is correct, the status light will turn green and the module will solve.
                    Otherwise, the module will reset and issue a strike.
                </p>
                <p>
                    If the bomb's timer (when the first click occurs) is less than the calculated time found below,
                    then the number of seconds will be equal to the remaining time on the bomb timer.
                </p>
                <h3>How to determine the correct formulas to use:</h3>
                <p>
                    Observe the last number of the serial. This value will be referred to as <i>N</i>. Follow the steps below in order to determine which formulas to use.
                    The formulas given can be found on the next page to solve The Tissue Box™.
                </p>
                <ul>
                    <li>N is 1, 2, 3, 4, or 5, and The Tissue Box™ is a cube: Formulas 2 &amp; 7.</li>
                    <li>N is 1, 2, 3, 4, or 5, and The Tissue Box™ is a rectangular prism: Formulas 1 &amp; 5.</li>
                    <li>N is 6, 7, 8, or 9, and The Tissue Box™ is a cube: Formulas 1 &amp; 5.</li>
                    <li>N is 0: Formulas 4 &amp; 8.</li>
                    <li>Otherwise: Formulas 3 &amp; 6.</li>
                </ul>

                <h3>Formulas to determine the correct amount of tissues to pull:</h3>
                <p class="highlightable"><b>Formula 1:</b> 10 * N</p>
                <p class="highlightable"><b>Formula 2:</b> (Number of batteries * number of ports + 10) * N</p>
                <p class="highlightable"><b>Formula 3:</b> 3 ^ (N-5)</p>
                <p class="highlightable"><b>Formula 4:</b> The sum of all serial number characters (convert letters to numbers; A = 1, B = 2, etc.)</p>
                <h3>Formulas to determine the amount of time available, in seconds:</h3>
                <p class="highlightable"><b>Formula 5:</b> 3.5 * N</p>
                <p class="highlightable"><b>Formula 6:</b> Number of batteries + number of ports + number of indicators + N + 5</p>
                <p class="highlightable"><b>Formula 7:</b> 45</p>
                <p class="highlightable"><b>Formula 8:</b> (Number of total modules on the bomb modulo 10) * 20. If the result of this calculation is 0, then you actually have 35 seconds.</p>
                <p>
                    Note: If any result is greater than 150, modulo the final answer by 150. This applies to both <u>time</u> and <u>amount</u> calculations.
                    If the value is 0 after performing the modulo operation, then add 1.
                    After all calculations have been performed, take the calculated tissues to pull divided by the total seconds.
                    If this result is greater than 5, then you should actually pull 80 tissues in 20 seconds.
