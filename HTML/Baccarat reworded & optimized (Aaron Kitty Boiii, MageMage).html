                <p><i><em>NOTE:</em> Should any issues with this manual arise please contact <u>Aaron Kitty Boiii#9947</u> and/or <u>MageMage#4892</u>.</i></p>
                <ul>
                    <li>This module resembles a Baccarat table with a deck of cards and a placard indicating table limits.</li>
                    <li>The color of the backs of the cards and the table limits can vary from module to module.</li>
                    <li>
                        To disarm this module, play one round in such a way that results in a net gain of money. A net loss of money will result in a strike.
                        Breaking even will neither disarm the module nor cause a strike.
                    </li>
                </ul>

                <h3>1. Determining the First Card's Index</h3>
                <p>
                    At the start of the module (as well as when a round begins and more than half of the previous deck’s cards have been dealt, indicated by a change in deck color),
                    you will have to calculate your starting card.<br> Otherwise just use the last played card from the previous round as the previous card played and go to step 2.
                </p>

                <p>
                    Based on the placard indicating the table limits, use the following two tables to get a letter and a digit from the serial number.<br>
                    (The ratio is the maximum posted table limit, <em>divided by</em> the minimum.)

                <h3>4. Determining Gameplay</h3>
                <p>
                    In Baccarat, the total point of a hand is the <em>least significant digit of the sum of all card’s values</em> in a hand.
                    The gameplay - and whether more cards will be drawn - are determined by following statements:
                </p>
                <ul>
                    <li>
                        If the <em>Player or Banker</em> has a total of <em>8 or 9 points</em> (after having dealt the first 4 cards), the round immediately ends with both point totals being their final scores.
                        No further cards are drawn.
                    </li>
                    <li>Otherwise, if the <em>Player</em> has a total of <em>6 or 7 points</em>, they stand with two cards.
                        <ul>
                            <li>If the Player stands and the <em>Banker</em> has a total of <em>6 or 7 points</em>, the Banker also stands with two cards.</li>
                            <li>If the Player stands and the <em>Banker</em> has a total of <em>5 or less points</em>, they draw the next card (Index 5).</li>
                        </ul>
                    </li>
                    <li>Otherwise, if the <em>Player</em> has a total of <em>5 or fewer points</em>, they draw the next card (Index 5).
                        In this case the Banker will themselves draw another card (Index 6) in the following situations:
                        <ul>
                            <li><em>Banker <b>total 7</b>:</em> Never</li>

                <h3>Betting</h3>
                <p>
                    To bet, place chips into the appropriate betting areas, use the arrow buttons to switch denominations of chips, hold a betting area to remove all chips in that area.
                    When Betting the <em>total amount of money bet has to be within the table limits.</em>
                </p>
                <p>
                    <em><b>IMPORTANT:</b></em> If wanting to place multiple denominations of chips in the same area, they must be ordered by value, with the largest on bottom and smallest on top.
                    Breaking this rule will result in a strike.
                </p>

                <ul>
                    <li> If the <em>Player</em> has the higher total, bet any allowed amount on the <em>Player betting area</em>.</li>
                    <li> If the <em>Banker</em> has the higher total, bet at least 2 on the <em>Player betting area</em>.</li>
                    <li>
                        If the <em>Player and Banker</em> tie in value, bet any allowed amount on the <em>Tie betting area</em>. (not more than one tenth of the maximum table limit)
                        Then, bet some amount on either the <em>Player or the Banker betting areas, but not both.</em> (Keeping in mind the table limits for the total bet)
                    </li>
                </ul>
                <p>
                    <em><b>NOTES:</b></em><br>
                    Player Pair & Banker Pair aren’t required to disarm the module in any circumstance.<br>
                    Betting only on the Player or Banker in case of a Tie will result in a break even (nothing happens), in this case refer back to Step 2 (marked with **). Also do this in case of a strike.
                </p>
                <p>After having placed the bets, press on the deck to deal out the cards and disarm the module.</p>
