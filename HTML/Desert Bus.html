                <h2>On the Subject of Desert Bus</h2>
                <p class="flavour-text">So grab a pen and tell 'er... that you're defusing a bomb.</p>
                <p>Vegas, baby! You're on the very straight, very clear road from Tucson, Arizona, to Las Vegas, Nevada, driving a bus.</p>
                <p>There are four "lanes": The left ditch, the left lane, the right lane, and the right ditch.</p>
                <p>When the needy is activated, the bus will begin its journey, starting in the left lane. To steer the bus, use the left and right buttons.</p>
                <p>If the bus stays in either ditch for 30 seconds, the bus will break down and you'll get a strike. You'll also be given a strike if the bus moves to the left of the left ditch, or to the right of the right ditch.</p>
                <p>Oh, and the bus has a slight list to the right. After the needy is activated, or after you steer the bus, the bus will move to the next lane to the right every 45 seconds.</p>
                <p>If you complete an eight-hour journey without the bus breaking down, congratulations! You score a point! Simply press start within one minute to continue and get some overtime! You really should, because if you don't press start in time, you'll get a strike.</p>
