                    <li>If at any point you need to divide by 0, don’t and skip the step.</li>
                    <li>To concatenate is to combine the digits in the order they appear. E.G. 12 || 34 becomes 1234.</li>
                    <li>To modulo is to subtract a number until the number you are subtracting is below the number you are subtracting by. If the number is negative, you add instead of subtract until it is positive.</li>
                    <li>Base 36 is your standard number system (i.e. from 0-9), but after 9, it becomes a then b then c, until you reach z. A would have the value of ten, b would be eleven, and so on.</li>
                    <li>The mode of a set of numbers is the most frequently occurring number. If there is a tie, there is no mode.</li>
                    <li>The median is the middle number when you arrange all numbers in a set in ascending order. If there is no definitive median from your set, then you include numbers in between the two left and find the median in that. E.G. the median of 1 4 6 7 would be 5.</li>
                    <li>To round down is to ignore all decimals.</li>
                    <li>The digital root of something is the repeated adding of all the digits in a number, until the number is a single digit.</li>
                    <li>*Paws Inc. Software is buggy. It is recommended to wait to give information until the audio and the video sync up.</li>
