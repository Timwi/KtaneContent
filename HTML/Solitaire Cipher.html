                <h2>On the Subject of the Solitaire Cipher</h2>
                <p class="flavour-text">It's not a game anymore, it's a cipher now.</p>
                <p>On the screen currently, you'll see a 6 letter encrypted word at the top with a submission cursor on the bottom.</p>
                <p>Pressing the blue circular button will toggle the screen to a new page. This new page will consist of 27 characters, 25 of them being A - Y, and the other 2 being 1 and 2. This is the key used to encrypt the word. Pressing the button again will bring it back to the other screen.</p>
                <p>The green circular button will submit any input you made while the red circular button will clear all input.</p>
                <p>Submit the decrypted word to disarm the module.</p>
                <h3>Cipher Mechanics</h3>
                <p>For each letter, this cipher makes it go through 2 steps: Shuffle and Encrypt.</p>
                <p>It first shuffles the key around using a set of instructions. Then encrypts the letter using Vigenere as it's main method. Thus, this creates a running keystream that seems random.</p>
                <p>Fear not! For the instructions below will explain how the shuffling and decrypting process works.</p>
                <h3>Shuffle Step</h3>
                <ol>
                    <li>Shift the character 1 to the right once, wrapping around if necessary.</li>
                    <li>Shift the character 2 to the right twice, wrapping around if necessary.</li>
                    <li>Swap the characters to the left of the leftmost number with the characters to the right of the rightmost number.</li>
                    <li>Count off the number of characters on the left equal to the alphanumeric position of last character of the key.</li>
                    <li>Take these characters and insert them inbetween the 2nd to last and last character of the key.</li>
                </ol>
                <p>The steps above can be simplified to this to make it easier to remember: Shift 1 and 2, Triple Cut, Count Cut.</p>

            <h3>Decrypt Step</h3>
            <p>Finally, follow the steps below to get your decrypted letter:</p>
                <ol>
                    <li>Count off the number of characters on the left equal to the alphanumeric position of the first character of the key.</li>
                    <li>Take note of the character AFTER the characters you counted in the key.</li>
                    <li>Subtract the alphanumeric position of the encrypted letter by the alphanumeric position of the character you got from the previous step.</li>
                    <li>Take this number, add 26 until it's a number between 1 - 26, and turn it back into a letter.</li>
                </ol>
            <h3>Extra Things</h3>
            <p>If the resulting character you got from any step was 1, use the 3rd character of the serial number, plus 1.</p>
            <p>If the resulting character you got from any step was 2, use the 6th character of the serial number, plus 1.</p>
            <p>The shifting of the 1 and 2 in this module isn't accurate to how the cipher is actually done. The cipher treats the key as if it was a giant circle. That meant when 1 or 2 was at the bottom, it would shift OVER the 1st character of the key. But I decided it to make it more "consistent" so that little part wouldn't trip you up every time that would occur.</p>
