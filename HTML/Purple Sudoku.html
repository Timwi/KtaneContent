                    <ul>
                        <li>The palette to the right of the sudoku grid is ordered 0-9. Any numbers referenced in this manual refer to the numerical value of the corresponding colour in the palette.</li>
                        <li>Selecting any colour from the palette then selecting any cells will apply that colour to those cells.</li>
                        <li>Pressing the ‘reset’ button will reset the sudoku grid to its starting state.</li>
                        <li>Upon pressing the ‘submit’ button, if the state of the grid is valid, the module will solve. If the state of the grid is not valid, a strike will be incurred.</li>

                    <p>
                        Fill the grid with colours such that no colour appears more than once in any row, column, or 3x3 box.<br>
                        Each cell is a building as many stories tall as its value.<br>
                        The clue lights around the edge of the grid indicate how many buildings can be seen from that perspective in the respective row or column.<br>
                        Taller buildings obscure shorter buildings behind them.<br>
                        A row of [1 9 3 4 5 6 2 8 7] would see two buildings from the left (1 and 9), and three buildings from the right (7, 8, and 9).
