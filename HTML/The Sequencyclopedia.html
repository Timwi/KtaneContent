                <h2>On the Subject of The Sequencyclopedia</h2>
                <p class="flavour-text">The only thing worse than an encyclopedia? One on a bomb.</p>
                <p>This module requires an internet connection in order to utilize the <a href="https://oeis.org/"><strong>On-Line Encyclopedia of Integer Sequences</strong></a>, a catalogue of sequences of numbers. If there is no internet connection, the module will resort to A000004, a sequence of entirely 0s. Enter 0 to solve the module.</p>
                <p>On the module, there are ten LEDs, all of them light up a certain color. There is also a screen that will display something in the form of “<b>A[6-digit-number]</b>”. You need to find this sequence in the database (Example: <a href="https://oeis.org/A000004"><strong>The Zero Sequence</strong></a>).</p>
                <p>The LEDs light up to represent a binary number. The red LEDs are the 0s, and the non-red LEDs are the 1s. The most significant digit is the leftmost LED. Using the sequence of LED colors, convert the binary number into decimal (This number will be denoted by the letter <b>A</b>).</p>
                <p>Also, gather the number of numbers listed on the sequence that was used by the module (This number will be denoted by the letter <b>B</b>). Using the previous number and the converted binary number, locate the number that must be submitted by using the calculation below. The calculation is based on the non-red LED color that was used.</p>
                <table>
                    <tr>
                        <th style="background-color: #00ff00">GREEN</th>
                        <td>The position of the number is in the <b>N</b>th position, where <b>N</b> is equal to <b>(A % B) + 1</b></td>
                    </tr>
                    <tr>
                        <th style="background-color: #0000ff">BLUE</th>
                        <td>The position of the number is in the <b>N</b>th position, where <b>N</b> is equal to <b>B - (A % B)</b></td>
                    </tr>
                </table>
                <p>After locating the number on the database, type the exact number on the module using the keypad below the displays. If the number gathered is negative, press the topmost display to type a negative sign [<b>This must be pressed first before typing the numbers. Pressing it later will cause it to not work]</b>. You can not erase the numbers already typed, so be careful with sending and typing the number.</p>
                <p>To submit the number typed on the module, press the center display. If the numbers do not match, the module denies the answer and strikes you. The module also resets after striking. If the numbers match, the module accepts the answer. This will solve the module.</p>
