                <h2>On the Subject of Functional Mapping</h2>
                <p class="flavour-text">Let me show you a map to the world, where the world is a function.</p>

                <p>On the module is a function diagram for a function f(x) being mapped, a stage number, and 2 buttons.
                <p>The function is being mapped in the form f: A -> B, where A is the domain (left side of the module) and B is the codomain (Right side of the module). The arrows then show which "preimage" or domain element gets mapped to an "image" or codomain element.</p>
                <p>To solve the module, you will have to press the correct button on top that is being displayed. There is a configuration for the number of stages you can have. For an understanding on what Surjection and Bijection is, look down below.</p>
                <h3>How to solve the module:</h3>
                <h5>Surjection:</h5>
                <p>A Surjection is a mapped function where for every element on the left side of the module, there is a element on the right side, and f(left side element) = right side element (or for math sakes, for every element a in A, there is an element b in B with f(a) = b). Also, the mapping can be many to one, meaning that a codomain element can have multiple domain elements mapped "onto" it.</p>
                <h5>Bijection:</h5>
                <p>A Bijection is a mapped function where every element is going to exactly ONE element and it surjective.</p>
