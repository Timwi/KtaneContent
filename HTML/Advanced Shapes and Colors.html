                <ul>
                    <li>The current clue will be displayed at the top of the module. You can cycle through each clue present on the module using the up/down arrow keys to the right of it.</li>
                    <li>At the bottom of the module is a 3×3 grid that can be filled using the selectors to the right of it.</li>
                    <li>Disarm the module by arranging the 3×3 grid in such a way that it fulfills every condition.</li>
                </ul>
                <h3 class="centered">Rules</h3>
                <ul>
                    <li>Fill the 3×3 grid in such a way that:</li>
                    <li>1: All positive clues (Blue Background) must fit somewhere on the grid.</li>
                    <li>2: All negative clues (Red Background) must NOT fit anywhere on the grid.</li>
                    <li>3: Each space is filled with a unique color/shape combination.</li>
                    <li>Pressing one of the values of the selector will select that value. Pressing it again will unselect it. Pressing a different value of the same type will select that value.</li>
                    <li>Pressing one of the spaces will enter the values onto that space you have currently selected.</li>
                    <li>Pressing the space again with a different type will add that value to the space. Pressing it again will remove that value from the space.</li>
                    <li>Pressing a space without any values selected will clear the space.</li>
                    <li>Submitting an unfinished grid will cause the module to strike.</li>
                    <li>Submitting a grid in such a way that a clue is not fulfilled or has a duplicate color/shape combination will cause the module to strike and generate a new puzzle.</li>

                <ul>
                    <li>The clue above tells us that there is a Blue Circle in the top right and a Red Diamond in the bottom middle.</li>

                <ul>				
                    <li>These next clues are partial clues, clues that only give some information. In this case, the Yellow Circle is either in the top middle or the top right while the Yellow Triangle is either in the top right or the middle right. We know for a fact that the Yellow Circle has to be in the top middle and the Yellow Triangle has to be in the middle right.</li>

                <ul>
                    <li>These next clues are going to be negative clues, meaning they must not fit anywhere on the grid. In this example, the Yellow Diamond can't be in the 2 bottom-most rows. Which means that the Yellow Diamond must fit somewhere on the top row. Fortunately, there is one spot on the top row where we can place the Yellow Diamond.</li>

                <ul>
                    <li>This next clue tells us that a Blue Triangle can not be underneath a space that contains the color yellow and vice versa. Placing a Blue Triangle at the middle left, center, or bottom right would make this clue valid if it were a positive clue. Because of that, the only spot for this Blue Triangle to be placed is the bottom left.</li>

                <ul>				
                    <li>Negative clues with negative clue elements can be a bit tricky to read. But don't fret! All you have to ask is this: If you were to place any shape but a Triangle in the bottom right space, would it satisfy the clue. If the answer is yes, then do the opposite to make sure this clue doesn't exist anywhere on the grid. Since this is the 3rd Triangle we are placing, the color of this Triangle has to be Red.</li>
                </ul>
                <p style = "text-align: center;"><img src="img/Advanced Shapes and Colors/Clue7.png"/> <img src="img/Advanced Shapes and Colors/Grid6.png"/></p>
                <ul>
                    <li>Finally, this clue tells us that the middle left space can't contain a Diamond. Since we already placed 3 Triangles and it can't contain a Diamond, then the space must contain a Circle. Since this is the 3rd Circle we are placing, the color of this shape has to be Red. Through the process of elmination, the center space must be filled with a Blue Diamond.</li>
