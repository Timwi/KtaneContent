                <h2>On the Subject of Seven Wires</h2>
                <p class="flavour-text">You thought wires were easy?</p>

                <p>This module has seven wires and a two-digit number on top.</p>
                <p>To disarm it, cut the correct wire for the first rule which applies. (Possible colors are red, yellow, black, and blue.)</p>

                <p><strong>IMPORTANT:</strong> If the wire for a rule is already cut, the rule is skipped.</p>
                <h3>Rules</h3>
                <ol>
                    <li>If there is a lit FRK and a lit CLR, cut the second wire.<br>Otherwise, go to rule 3.</li>
                    <li>If the number is between 00–99, cut the first wire.</li>
                    <li>If there is a solved Forget Everything or Forget Me Not on the bomb, cut the sixth wire.</li>
                    <li>If the serial number contains only vowels and numbers, cut the wire whose position is of the last digit of the serial %8. (0 = 1)</li>
                    <li>If the number appears on The Swan's reset code, cut the fourth wire.</li>
                    <li>If the number is 00, cut the sixth wire.</li>
                    <li>If all the modules on the bomb are made by Timwi, cut the 47th wire (or the fourth or seventh).</li>
                    <li>If the amount of solved modules is at least 2 and a multiple of 6, cut the first wire.</li>
                    <li>If there is a Laundry unicorn, cut any wire.</li>
                    <li>If there are more than 5 batteries on the bomb, cut the fifth wire.</li>
                    <li>If there are less than 0 batteries on the bomb, cut the third wire.</li>
                    <li>If all the wires are yellow and/or blue, cut the fifth wire.</li>
                    <li>If a previous rule was true (except from rule 2), cut the first wire.</li>
                    <li>If the number is divisible by 20, cut the seventh wire.</li>
                    <li>If the fifth wire is black and there are eight wires, cut the fifth wire.</li>
                    <li>If there is exactly one red wire and 1 battery on the module, cut the second wire.</li>
                    <li>If the number is divisible by 0, cut the seventh wire.</li>
                    <li>If the serial number contains a Y or a 0, cut the third wire.</li>
                </ol>
