                <h2>On the Subject of Black Screens</h2>
                <p class="flavour-text">Bypassing... Done! Wait, it was too easy.</p>

                <p>Hello, expert! We have sent you on a mission to crack the code of this barmy module! The bomb where your module is will contain all code info so no fretting! Just chop, chopping!</p>

                <h3>Screen messages</h3>
                <p>As you can see, the module has been set with a display. Simply count the amount of letters on each display and use this number for the corresponding codes. The top is used for Code 1, right used for Code 2, bottom used for Code 3.</p>

                <h3>Solving</h3>
                <p>When all row locks have been disabled, simply fool the bomb into solving the module by pressing the centre button.</p>

                <h3>Striking</h3>
                <p>If a button is not safe, it is dangerous (will strike) and vice versa.</p>

                <h3>Code 1 (Top row)</h3>
                <h4>Screen number less than 3</h4>
                <ul>
                    <li>If there are 2 or less port types, the first one will disable the locks.</li>
                    <li>If the bomb has any strikes, the second button will strike.</li>
                    <li>If the second button is dangerous, the third button will unlock the top row.</li>
                </ul>

                <h4>Screen number between 3 and 5</h4>
                <ul>
                    <li>If there are 15 mins or less, the first one will disable the locks.</li>
                    <li>If there are more than 10 minutes on the bomb, the second button will strike.</li>
                    <li>If there are 10 or less batteries on the bomb (that’s a big one!), the third button will unlock the top row.</li>
                </ul>

                <h4>Screen number bigger than 5</h4>
                <ul>
                    <li>If there are 16 mins or less, the first one will disable the locks.</li>
                    <li>If the bomb has 2 or more strikes, the second button will strike.</li>
                    <li>If the second button is dangerous, the third button will unlock the top row.</li>

                <ul>
                    <li>If there is a minute or less on the bomb, the first one will disable the locks.</li>
