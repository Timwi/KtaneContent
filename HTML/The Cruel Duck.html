                <ul>
                    <li>The module will start off as a closed curtain. This curtain will specify what environment the duck lives in and its personality. After revealing what is behind the curtain (depending on what is behind the curtain), you will have several approach options and items to choose from.</li>
                    <li>Be careful, because if you incur a strike, the curtains, if not already closed, will close again and display a different pattern with different colors.</li>
                </ul>
                <h3>Curtain Pattern</h3>
                <p>Follow this chart to see what the curtain pattern means.</p>

                <h3>The Big Reveal</h3>
                <p>After determining the habitat of the duck and its personality, you can click on the curtain to reveal what is behind it.</p>
                <p>There are a few possibilities on what could happen:</p>
                <ol>
                    <li>The curtain opens and there is nothing behind it. :(</li>
                    <li>The curtain opens and— DAMN IT, ANOTHER DAMN PELICAN.</li>
                    <li>The curtain opens and an actual duck is behind it.</li>
                </ol>
                <p>If there is nothing behind the curtain, take all the numbers in the serial number and add them up. Then subtract 5 until you get a digit that is between 0 and 9 (unless the number is already between 0 and 9). Click the curtains again when the seconds digit on the bomb's timer reaches the number you calculated.</p>
                <p>If the curtain opens and one of those gosh-diddly-darn pelicans is behind it, refer to <em>Reverse Approach</em>.</p>
                <p>If the curtain opens and there's an actual duck, refer to <em>Approach</em>.</p>
