                <h2>On the Subject of Probing</h2>
                <p class="flavour-text">Not that kind of probing...</p>

                <p>This module has six wires and two crocodile clips.
                Each wire carries three alternating currents (AKA 3-phase
                current), each phase a different frequency. The possible
                frequencies are 10Hz, 22Hz, 50Hz and 60Hz.</p>

                <p>In order to probe the circuit you need to connect the red
                clip to a wire and the blue clip to a different wire.
                Common frequencies in both wires will cancel out
                and the display will show the remaining frequencies,
                in order from lowest to highest.</p>

                <p>If the red and white wire contains a 50Hz current connect
                the red clip to the wire with the frequencies
                10Hz, 22Hz and 60Hz, otherwise if the red and yellow
                wire does not contain a 10Hz current connect the red clip
                to the wire with the frequencies 22Hz, 50Hz and 60Hz, otherwise
                connect the red clip to the wire with the
                frequencies 10Hz, 22Hz and 50Hz.</p>

                <p>If the yellow and red wire contains a 10Hz current connect the blue clip to the
                wire with the frequencies 10Hz, 50Hz and 60Hz otherwise connect the blue clip to
                the wire that contains the frequencies 10Hz, 22Hz and 50Hz.</p>

                <p>Leave the clips connected for at least six seconds to defuse. Leaving the
                incorrect wires connected for more than six seconds will cause a strike.</p>

                <p class="comment">NOTE: Be aware that each time a strike is gained the frequencies in each wire may change.</p>
