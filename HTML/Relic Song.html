                <h2>On the Subject of Relic Song</h2>
                <p class="flavour-text">“When I feel a little sour, when I feel I got no power left...”</p>

                <p>The module consists of a sheet music with a black clef-looking piece on its side.</p>
                <p>This module has <b class="info">two Modes</b>: one with the sheet music green and clef on the left, the other with the sheet music orange and clef on the right.</p>
                <p>Every time a <a href="../More/Ignore%20Table.html#mod=Relic%20Song">non-ignored module</a> is solved, the current Mode <strong>can</strong> (but might not) change, and a series of 3-5 Notes will appear on the lines of the stave.</p>
                <p>For every stage, record the Notes’ heights (the horizontal placement doesn’t matter) as well as the Mode they appear in, and <strong>apply the following rules for every Note</strong>:</p>
                <ul>
                    <li>If a Note has appeared in both Modes, ignore both appearances as they Cancel each other out.</li>
                    <li>If a Note appears multiple times in the same Mode without having been Canceled, ignore the duplicate appearances in this Mode.</li>
                    <li>For both Modes, keep track of all Note heights that have appeared but have not been Canceled out nor ignored.</li>
                </ul>

                <p>When all other non-ignored modules have been solved, the sheet music will show all five possible Note heights as empty circles, and the module can now be solved.</p>
                <p>
                    Input all Note heights that have appeared in the current Mode but have not been Canceled out nor ignored.<br>
                    After inputting the correct Notes, press the clef to switch Mode.<br>
                    Pressing a wrong Note or switching Mode without all expected Notes being pressed will result in a Strike.
                </p>
                <p>Once both Modes have been filled with the correct Notes, press the clef once more to submit and solve the module.</p>
