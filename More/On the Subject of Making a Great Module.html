                        <h2>On the Subject of Making a Great Module</h2>
						<p>There are many things to do and many things to avoid while making a new module. Here is a list of tips to consider when developing a module.</p>

                        <h3>1. Begin With a Working Manual</h3>
						<p>This is the most important part of developing a module. Make sure that you have a solid idea and a clear description of how each part of the module will work. This will allow you (or someone who is developing the module for you) to properly implement the module as intended.</p>

						<h3>2. Don’t be Afraid to Change</h3>
                        <p>Often when developing a module, you realize that an idea you had or part of your manual is impossible (or at least very difficult) to implement. Instead of wasting your time trying to find a solution to the problem which is out of your skill set, consider changing your idea to better suit the constraints. You don’t always have to change your idea, but remember that it might be necessary.</p>

                        <h3>3. Playtest, Playtest, Playtest</h3>
                        <p>Always playtest your module. Anytime you make a significant change, solve the module a few times to try and catch some bugs. Even if you don’t make a significant change, it never hurts to try solving it again. Also remember to have several people playtest your module before releasing it. In addition, if you notice strange behaviour, do not leave it. Try to figure out what is causing it. </p>

                        <h3>4. Don’t Skimp on Your Logging</h3>
                        <p>It is always a good idea to log too much information than too little. It can be nearly impossible to spot what is causing a bug with improper logging. Over time, the KTANE community will let you know if some information is unnecessary or needed, but it is better to err on the side of caution. As a guide, try to:</p>
                        <ul>
                            <li>provide the solution to the module and an explanation on how to get to that solution. Also consider logging every possible solution at the beginning of the module if the solution can change once or twice at some point during the bomb (such as conditions that take into account strike or solved module counts).</li>
                        </ul>                            
                    </div>
                    <div class="page-footer relative-footer">Page 1 of 3</div>
                </div>
                <div class="page page-bg-02">
                    <div class="page-header">
                        <span class="page-header-doc-title">Keep Talking and Nobody Explodes Guide</span>
                        <span class="page-header-section-title">Entering the World of Mods</span>
                    </div>
                    <div class="page-content">
                        <ul>
                        <li>provide information that would be useful to players trying to figure out mistakes. In particular, log the user input (such as button presses). This will help players find out if there was simply some miscommunication, an error while inputting the solution, or perhaps a bug in the module.</li>

                        <li>include "Strike" and "Module Disarmed" messages. The game puts messages in the log file when these events happen, but the <a href="https://ktane.timwi.de/More/Logfile%20Analyzer.html">Logfile Analyzer</a> can't parse them.</li>
                        </ul>
                        <h3>5. Avoid Common Module Features that are Considered “Not Fun”</h3>
                        <ul>
                            <li><strong>Unicorns</strong></li>
                            <p>Unicorns are most commonly found in BOB rules. They generally make the module slightly more difficult to solve and rarely add anything of value to the solve. </p>
                        </ul>                            
                        <ul>
                            <li><strong>“Cruel” Versions</strong></li>
                            <p>“Cruel” versions of modules often don’t see play and are not received well in most cases. They usually add unnecessary complications to the “normal” module that don’t have any interesting challenge or functionality associated with them. </p>
                        </ul>                            
                        <ul>
                            <li><strong>Overly Complicated Manuals</strong></li>
                            <p>“Fun” does not necessarily mean making the module more complicated. Fun modules have interesting functional components and solving methods (which may be complicated) rather than unnecessary complexity which just makes a module harder to solve. </p>
                        </ul>                            
                        <ul>
                            <li><strong>Minor Variations on Vanilla Modules</strong></li>
                            <p>In general, slight variations of the vanilla modules rarely go over well. A great module is one that has original ideas, good design, and a lot of creativity. Just making a few tweaks to the manual, changing a few rules for added difficulty, or rearranging rules have almost never been enough to make a module stand out.</p>
                        </ul>

                        <h3>6. Make Your Module Open Source</h3>
                        <p>There are many benefits to making the source of your mods public. Here are a few:
					    <ul>
						    <li>Fellow modders can easily help you fix issues.</li>
                            <li>Your modules will still be maintainable if you happen to stop developing, increasing their longevity.</li>
							<li>If done correctly, you will have a full version history of your mod so that you can revert file(s) to a previous revision if necessary.</li>
                        </ul></p>
                        <p>Make sure to include all the project files as well as the code or issues may arise when testing or updating. Often this can be difficult to set up properly, so here is a <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sUmBzfIsl-U">link</a> to a guide to do that.</p>
                        

                        <h3>7. Use the Community</h3>
					    <p>The KTANE community will let you know what they think of your module, whether it be good or bad reviews. Remember to be respectful and to listen to what they are saying. If the community finds a bug or mistake, fix it. If they suggest a change or commenting on your module, make sure to find out why they are saying it and consider their input. Also, if you ever need help, feel free to nicely ask for help in #modding and most of the time, someone will be happy to help. However, if you do ask for help, make sure to be specific and include and error messages or relevant code (having your source on GitHub can help with this, see #6). Join the KTANE Discord server <a href = "https://discord.gg/Fv7YEDj">here</a>.</p>

                        <h3>8. Spend Time on Aesthetics</h3>
                        <p>Some modules aren’t taken well simply due to their looks. Make sure to spend some time cleaning up your module, and checking to make sure everything looks okay. Remember to check blurry/stretched text, oddly shaped buttons (due to scaling), text that looks “lit up” when the lights turn off, meshes without materials, etc. In addition, check the manual. Is is legible and is the information organized clearly? Does the module image accurately represent the module, in the .svg file format? Any time spent making your module and manual look better will easily add to its value in the long run.</p>
