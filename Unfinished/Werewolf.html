                    <p class="flavour-text">This manual is from a flier from 1966, found in a small town of Wolf Summit, WV.</p>
                    <ul class="descrip">
						<li>This module has four names of people sitting around in a circle with two buttons, green and red, on the bottom right and left, labelled “E” and “C”. Your objective is to find the Werewolf and eradicate that player after three nights. To figure out what happened the week when this first began, use the chart below and pinpoint a Werewolf.</li>
                        <li>If there is more than one Werewolf, eliminating one will suffice for this town.
                        </li>
                    </ul>

                    <h3><span class="where">Turn order: </span> <span class="were">doppelganger, Werewolf, Seer, Robber, Troublemaker, Insomniac, Drunk</span><br><span class="where">Other Roles: </span><span class="were">Villager, Hunter, Tanner</span></h3>
					<br>
					<br>
					<br>
					<br>
					<div class="where" style="text-indent: 5%">
						<p>What each Person does is based on the people on the chart below.</p>
						<p>The Chart Will Explain over the course of the three nights, what all have happened. If a character’s role changed during the middle of the night and a person hasn’t done their night role yet, continue as they were still the role before they were switched. Over the course of the night, each character knows what they then assume once a new night begins.No one will do two night actions unless they’re a doppelganger, in which case on their second turn, will assume the role they took in the same fashion as that person would.</p>
						<p>Read the person’s roles by their turn order each night. If two or more people share the same role, the northern players would go first, then clockwise from there.</p>
						<p>A person’s role might switch when moving over to the next night. Change role order accordingly.</p>
