                <h2>On the Subject of Most Wanted Cards</h2>
                <p class="flavour-text">Of all the US military equipment to end up on a bomb, a deck of playing cards is somehow the most fitting.</p>
                <p class="appendix-reference">See the below page for deck reference.</p>

                <p>The module has eight playing cards from the US Army Iraqi Most Wanted deck, which can be cyled using the arrow buttons. Each card has a rank and suit, as well as a name, title and picture. Exactly two peices of information on each card will be incorrect.</p>
                <p>Observe the starting card and determine which pieces of information on it are incorrect, as well as the <strong>actual</strong> rank and suit.</p>
                <p>Use the incorrect information to obtain the indexes of two key cards, and use the rank modulo 8 to obtain the third, taking Ace as 1, and face cards as 11-13. If this is 0, use 8. If it is already a key card, add 1 until it is not.</p>
                <p>Use the suit to obtain a piece of information. For each key card in module order from most to least significant, take a 1 if that piece of info is correct and a 0 if not. Convert the resulting binary to decimal, again taking 0 as 8, to obatin the card you need to sumbit.</p>
                <p>Take the displayed rank of the card, handling non-numeric as above, and use it to index into <strong>the name associated with the picture on the card</strong>. If the picutre is unknown, use the card's actual name. Press the card when the last seconds digit is the alphabetic position of that letter modulo 10.</p>>
