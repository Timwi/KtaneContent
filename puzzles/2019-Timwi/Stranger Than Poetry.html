            <p>I have some peculiar friends, some go-getters<br>
            with no skills in knitting, just bad nascent sweaters.</p>

            <p>You let them grow fruits in their basements downstairs,<br>
            they’ll still end up calling them sun-powered pears.</p>

            <p>When brewing some Earl Grey, my strange friend asked me:<br>
            “Say, is it impossible to burn the tea?”</p>

            <p>He is truly weird. He likes hobby horses<br>
            and he says at college there's too many courses.</p>

            <p>His oddest idea for a business in Glasford?<br>
            A blunt, ambidextrous, or “mix-handed”, brass sword.</p>

            <p>In matters of politics, he thinks the nation<br>
            would benefit greatly from feudalization.</p>

            <p>I’ll tell you ’bout one time I had grave concerns.<br>
            He messed with a candle; endured waxy burns.</p>

            <p>While tending the wound, he tripped over a beam<br>
            and fell on a rock. It was not a nice scream.</p>

            <p>The ambulance came and said he needed stitches.<br>
            Afraid of the doctors, he just hollered, “Witches!”</p>

            <p>He insulted them. Accusations he made.<br>
            It soon turned into an incendiary charade!</p>

            <p>He made it eventually, though in an absurd space.<br>
            So long story short, he’s a weird old birdface.</p>

            <p>He doesn't like poker; he says he's not cardsy.<br>
            And he'll get offended if you call him artsy.</p>
