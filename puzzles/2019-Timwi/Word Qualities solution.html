        <h2>Solution</h2>
        <p>The wheels are reminiscent of the <a href='../../HTML/Chord Qualities.html'>Chord Qualities</a> module.</p>
        <p>Each wheel has one letter highlighted in yellow. Those highlighted letters correspond to a musical note. If we replace the other letters with the rest of the notes appropriate to their relative position to the highlighted one, we get a standard Chord Qualities puzzle, which we can solve normally according to the rules of the module.</p>
        <p>After obtaining the solution (which consists of a four-note chord in each wheel), we can put the original letters back in and see which letters the module solutions point to.</p>
        <p>This spells out the clue phrase: <span class='clue-phrase'>“TAKE THAT” SONG THAT SAYS “NEED TIME”</span>.</p>
        <p>In some regions, googling for that exact phrase finds <a href='https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=273eSvOwpKk'>the answer</a> immediately. For everyone else, the only discovery necessary is that “Take That” is the name of a band and we’re looking for a song of theirs whose lyrics contains the words “need time”.</p>
