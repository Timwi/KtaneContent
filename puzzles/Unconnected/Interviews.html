        <h1>Interviews</h1>
        <p class="flavour-text">When it comes to the kind of people in my cubicle, today was an interesting day.</p>
        <div>We asked 8 oddly blocky men to state something that meant a lot to them.</div>

        <div class='interviewee'>One who has a law about things going wrong, any member of the human race. (6 6)<p class='phrase'>“What I have 5 of.”</p></div>
        <div class='interviewee'>Measurement of sugar to swallow medicine, one who was AMAB but is now female. (8 11)<p class='phrase'>“From where my simpler counterpart was recovered.”</p></div>
        <div class='interviewee'>This subject did not have a name. Well, they did, but it was the word we’ve been ignoring. (3)<p class='phrase'>“The one who reworded me.”</p></div>
        <div class='interviewee'>Jewish greeting, where Holland’s Pies are from. (6 8)<p class='phrase'>“What I don't think will fix me.”</p></div>
        <div class='interviewee'>Singer-songwriter Amos, otorhinolaryngologist, preposition meaning being present, atom charge acquisition. (4 3 2 10)<p class='phrase'>“Simple. The first word in my name.”</p></div>
        <div class='interviewee'>Shortened word for professional worker living outside his native country, balanced system used by Simon. (5 7)<p class='phrase'>“The color of what is labeled ‘1’.”</p></div>
        <div class='interviewee'>Not a seraph or a throne, home town of Mireuksa. (6 5)<p class='phrase'>“The 2nd column.”</p></div>
        <div class='interviewee'>This subject had an identical first name to the last man who came in. Technically, he shouldn’t be here, but we let him in because they are brothers.<p class='phrase'>“The first one where the number of glowing labels matters.”</p></div>
