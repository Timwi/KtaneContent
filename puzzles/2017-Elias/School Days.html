            <p>Toshi is ready to start his school days, but his schedule is all mixed up. Piece back together when he has his five classes.</p>

                1. Each class meets three times a
                week. Each of these meetings is on a
                different day.
            <p>
                2. The Literature class meets the same
                time all three days. No other class
                meets the same time on any two days.
            <p>
                3. Toshi is in class during lunch hour
                (noon) only on Wednesdays and
                Fridays.
            <p>
                4. Toshi always goes immediately to
                his Calculus classes from his Astronomy
                classes.
            <p>
                5. Toshi is a heavy sleeper, so he has 8
                o’clock open Mondays–Wednesday.
            <p>
                6. Toshi gets mentally exhausted on
                Mondays, going to his Physics class
                immediately after his Calculus class.
            <p>
                7. Toshi has one day of the schedule
                completely clear.
            <p>
                8. Toshi has Geography at 8 on Thursday; his first of four classes that day. Like all times he has
                Geography, he has an open period immediately after.
            <p>9. Tuesday and Wednesday, Toshi has work from 10–12, and can’t be in class during those times.
            <p>10. Either Toshi has Geography at 12 Wednesday, or Literature at 12 Friday, but not both.
            <p>11. Monday is the only day Toshi has Physics but not Geography.
            <p>12. Friday has a break at 10 to rest, but that is the only time slot without a class.
