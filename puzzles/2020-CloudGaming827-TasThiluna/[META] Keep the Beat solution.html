		<h2>Solution</h2>
		<p>The feeder answers for this puzzle are video game titles. Each title can be placed at the ends of the sentences seen in the puzzle. Then, the blanks can be filled in with modules which correspond to the statement.
		<table align='center'>
			<tr>
				<th>Module:</th>
				<th>Text:</th>
				<th>Video game:</th>
			</tr>
			<tr>
				<td>THE CRAFTING TABLE</td>
				<td>was the first module based on</td>
				<td>MINECRAFT (<a href='Rainbow Collection.html'>Rainbow Collection</a>)</td>
			</tr>
			<tr>
				<td>PLACEHOLDER TALK</td>
				<td>uses sound effects from</td>
				<td>ONESHOT (<a href='No More.html'>No More</a>)</td>
			</tr>
			<tr>
				<td>PASSPORT CONTROL</td>
				<td>is based on</td>
				<td>PAPERS PLEASE (<a href='DUCK!.html'>DUCK!</a>)</td>
			</tr>
			<tr>
				<td>ART APPRECIATION</td>
				<td>is a reference to the sequel to</td>
				<td>PORTAL (<a href='Symbols with Enigmatic Traits.html'>Symbols with Enigmatic Traits</a>)</td>
			</tr>
			<tr>
				<td>FRUITS</td>
				<td>can be chosen instead of mushrooms in</td>
				<td>STARDEW (<a href='Subtractive Geography.html'>Subtractive Geography</a>)</td>
			</tr>

		<p>Once the modules are filled in, certain letters can be associated with colors (in the box with +17, you must Caesar shift the F to W). These colors are from <a href="">Odd One Out</a> and they can order the letters; however, the note at the bottom of the puzzle tells us that, unlike Weird Wall, we should order the colors by name, not value. This gives us the cluephrase <span class="clue-phrase">INSTALL OSU FOLLOW INSTRUCTION</span>. This means nothing on its own, but the flavor text hints at <a href="https://tinyurl.com/">tinyurl</a>. Plugging the string into a tinyurl link takes us to a <a href="https://github.com/The-Puzzle-Vault/keepthebeat">github repo</a> that has a file called "Puzzle Plethora.osz" available to download.</p>
		<p>.osz files store "beatmaps," which are levels in the free-to-play rhythm game <a href='https://osu.ppy.sh/home'>osu!</a>. When the file is dropped into a copy of the game, the name of the author, the name of the only available level present, and the objects within the level itself spell out a the phrase <span class='clue-phrase'>WRITE US A NEW MODULE</span>. When writing a manual for a module idea and sending it to either of the hunt managers, they'll give you a serial number that serves as the solution.</p>
		<p class="solution">T24JK1</p>
		<p>Not only is osu! free-to-play, but it also has an option to have levels auto-complete themselves. If a solver told a hunt runner that they found the level too difficult, they would have pointed out this option. Should a solver inform a hunt runner that they had technical difficulties installing or using osu!, or obtaining the .osz file, they would have simply given them the instructions to write a manual.</p>
