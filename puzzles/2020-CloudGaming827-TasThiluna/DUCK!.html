		<p class='flavour-text'>There were many things we could have done with these cards, but of course we chose DUCK!.</p>
		<p>"Ooh! Some cards!" Mark says as he rushes over to the table. You check your watch. Yeah, you've got time. "Wanna play?" You ask.<br>"Sure! What are you thinking?"<br>"You pick."<br>"DUCK!" He says happily.<br>Not your favorite game, but you choose not to argue. You need something to kill the time.<br><br>As you sit down you quickly scan the instructions, just to remind yourself of the rules.</p>
		<table class="rules">
			<tr><td>
				<u><b>Set up:</b></u><br>
				Shuffle the deck of cards and deal each player 7 cards. Place the deck face down in the middle of the play area. Make sure each player has room for a discard pile.
				<hr>
				<u><b>Gameplay:</b></u><br>
				The players take turns, going in a clockwise direction around the table. During a player’s turn, if they have two cards with matching values, they take those cards and place them down.
				<br>
				<br>
				During each turn, player A asks player B if they have a card of a certain value. If player B does, they hand player A the card with that value and player A places down the pair. If player B doesn’t have any cards of a matching value, they shout “DUCK!” and player A is forced to draw a card from the deck. It is now the next player’s turn and the process repeats.
				<br>
				<br>
				When it’s a player’s turn they can choose to discard a card from their hand, but only one. When the card is discarded, they place it in a separate pile and draw a new card from the deck. Their turn has now ended.
				<hr>
				<u><b>Determining Card Values:</b></u>
				<br>
				Each card receives its value based on its suit using certain rules which alter the initial value of the card (Ace = 1; King = 13). These rules are determined by you, the players of the game. We've provided some space here for you to write out what your rules are:
				<br>
				<br>
				<u><i>Hearts:</i></u>
				<br>
				<span class="cardvalues">This one is easy. A 10 year old could get this.</span>
				<br>
				<br>
				<u><i>Clubs:</i></u>
				<br>
				<span class="cardvalues">We got even with this one. Similar to hearts, but the lucky clovers helped us out.</span>
				<br>
				<br>
				<u><i>Diamonds:</i></u>
				<br>
				<span class="cardvalues">I would recommend checking your discard pile once in a while.</span>
				<br>
				<br>
				<u><i>Spades:</i></u>
				<br>
				<span class="cardvalues">This one is a bit odd...and backwards.</span>
				<br>
				<br>
				<hr>
				<u><b>Winning:</b></u><br>
				The game ends when either a player cannot draw a card anymore, or a player has placed all cards in their hand, whichever is first. Whoever has the most pairs at the end of the game is the winner. If there is a tie, we don’t care what you do for a tie breaker, just be safe and reasonable.
				<br>
				<br>
				Oh! One last thing, have fun! It is a game after all.

			<p>You realize the cards are dealt and examine your hand. Mark has already placed down a pair of 11s. Lucky.</p>
			<img src='DUCK!/Start.png' class="center">
			<p>You're up first. You ask for a 6 and with a look of disappointment Mark hands you a card and you place your pair down. The cards might be on your side today.<br><br>Mark discards something, and draws something else.<br><br>You choose to do the same, getting rid of an 8.<br><br>Mark tries to ask you for an 11, but you don't have one. "DUCK!" You shout, slightly startling him. He draws a card.<br><br>Back to you. Maybe he has a 3? <br>"DUCK!"<br>...you draw a card.<br><br>The back and forth continues, Mark asked for a 14, you asked for an 8 (again), both failures. Both loud and already annoying DUCK!s.<br><br>Mark adds a card to his discard pile, drawing another. You keep trying to ask him for a card. A 5 this time, but you hear the dreadful "DUCK!" and your hand of cards grows bigger.<br><br>Mark tries stealing a 9 this time..."DUCK!".<br><br>You decide to discard something else, and draw a 13 in its place.<br><br>Finally something different happens, but unfortunately, not for you. Mark asks you for an 8, which you have. He places down his next pair.<br><br>You carefully examine your cards and see a 20. It's a worthless card, so you move it into your discarded pile, drawing a better card from the deck.<br><br>Mark asks for an 11. The "DUCK!" arrives and a card is drawn.<br><br>Your luck comes back when you ask for a 12, which Mark had, and you took.<br><br>Mark asks for a 17, which you don't have, and you ask for a 16, which he doesn't have. You both gain one card.<br><br>Well, Mark tries again, asking for a 7 instead. You do have one of those, so you hand it over. Another pair for Mark.<br><br>You discard a 14 and draw a new card.<br><br>Mark asks for another card you didn't have. You do the same to him. Once again, you two draw a card.<br><br>He discards another card.<br><br>The little luck you have left seems to drop even more as you ask him for a 16. He shouts "DUCK!" and you draw from the deck.<br><br>Mark looks at his hand with an intense stare...for almost too long. The silence is interrupted with, "Got any 3s?"<br>"Wow. Okay." You hand him the 3 you've been holding on to.<br><br>"Okay, okay." You say. "Got any 5s?"<br>"DUCK!"<br>"Argh!" You take a deep breath and the game continues.<br><br>Mark's turn. He asks for a 13.<br>This is fine.<br>You give him your card and ask him for a 14.<br>"DUCK!"<br>Okay then.<br><br>Mark asks you for a card which thankfully you don't have.<br><br>Time to change things up. You trade a card, placing it in the discard pile and drawing another.<br><br>Mark asks you for a card and you give him the DUCK!.<br><br>You ask for a 7 and he gives you...a card! A pair scored! Although, Mark asks you for a 11...a pair scored.<br><br>You discard your 9. It hasn't really helped. Another card takes its place.<br><br>Mark asks you for a 4.<br>"DUCK!"<br><br>You check your hand and remember Mark asking for a 13. You check your discard pile...yes!<br>"Got any 13s?"<br>"Yup..."<br><br>Mark asks for yet another card, but ends up drawing one from the deck instead.<br><br>You ask him for any 14s and score another pair.<br><br>He asks for a 15, but you shout "DUCK!"<br><br>Then you ask for a 1, and he returns the favor...with another "DUCK!".<br><br>When you draw the card, you see Mark swiftly place a card in his discard pile, but you didn't notice the card you drew made a pair.</p>
			<p>Suddenly your phone rings. “We have to go.” You tell Mark.<br>“Is it because I’m winning?” He jokes.<br>“No. It’s a bomb!”<br>“Really!? But it’s Saturday? I’m not on duty right now.”<br>“Well...they said they needed us, so let’s go.”<br>Unfortunately, you two couldn’t finish the game. Although, as a puzzler, you see the words spelled, which is kinda funny when you think of how slim the chance of that happening is.</p>
