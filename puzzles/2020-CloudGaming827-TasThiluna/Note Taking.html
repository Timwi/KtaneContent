        <p>3 in 2 // [par ser] [rj ps2 dvi rca] [rj ps2 dvi rca] [ser] // QW4 AH3<br>Note to self: Next time, I should use correction fluid to erase my mistakes.</p>
		<p>5 in 3 // *SIG // [dvi rca] // EN9 CJ1<br>Note to self: After this bomb, I’ll have a refreshing glass of something similar to lemonade.</p>
		<p>1 in 1 // *CAR BOB // [rca rj] [] // J38 KA9<br>Note to self: I really didn’t like this bomb that much. I’d rather be playing a game with cowboys from 2018.</p>
		<p>2 in 1 // TRN NSA // [par] [] // NM6 RA3<br>Note to self: During this bomb, I was listening to Prince’s 6th studio album.</p>
