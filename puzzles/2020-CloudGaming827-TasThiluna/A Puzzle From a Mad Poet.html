		<p class='flavour-text'>This puzzle need not be poetic to run!<br>I wrote it this way so I could have fun.</p>
		<p style="text-align:center">You’ve discovered my puzzle that’s mased on a game!<br>Plebse don’t blow it up. It’d be quite a shame.</p>
		<p style="text-align:center">But you’ll have a glum ikeology unless<br>I give you some cluec that you can address.</p>
		<p style="text-align:center">The first styp you’ll probably find not intense.<br>Does a module make chis sequence make sense?</p>
		<p style="text-align:center">This is seeming sk wry! O me, O my!<br>You should stay with the poem to keep ceeling fly.</p>
		<p style="text-align:center">The theme I keep finding as likery apparent;<br>Be aware whgre things are and the rest is transparent.</p>
		<p style="text-align:center">A lekter like this we find often exciting,<br>but its home is the feabure you should be highlighting.</p>
		<p style="text-align:center">You’re making good progrmss! Don’t let yourself fall!<br>What you have cight now is not quite yet all.</p>
		<p style="text-align:center">The long yarn-like gubstance from a programmer’s hives<br>Exisc with restrictions of a six and two fives.</p>
		<p style="text-align:center">What you’ve crvered already? That’s just the start!<br>Keep carreling forward and you’ve got the part!</p>
		<p style="text-align:center">In your restrictions you havk two of the same.<br>Ic they didn’t start similarly, that would be lame.</p>
		<p style="text-align:center">Hopefully now you should have your farr share<br>of some interesting thikgs; from each, take a pair.</p>
		<p style="text-align:center">The rest may be obvious, but to cross that borker,<br>put the remainder in alphabetccal order.</p>
		<p style="text-align:center">If it doesw’t make sense now, you might just be sickly.<br>The puzzle based on a came has now been solved quickly.</p>
