		<h2>Solution</h2>
		<p>The poem gives instructions on how to solve the puzzle. Each line has one letter changed, you need to look at these new letters and disregard the original ones (which spell BAD SET OF LETTERS TO BE FINDING). This gives a line similar to one from <a href="https://ktane.timwi.de/HTML/Simon%20Sends.html">Simon Sends</a>: <span class="clue-phrase">MBKCYCKCRGKBMCGCRCKCRKKCWC = R - 5 (E), G - 4 (D), B - 2 (B)</span>.
		<p style="text-align:center">You’ve discovered my puzzle that’s <span class="color">M</span>ased on a game!<br>Ple<span class="color">B</span>se don’t blow it up. It’d be quite a shame.</p>
		<p style="text-align:center">But you’ll have a glu<span class="clue-phrase">M I<span class="color">K</span>E<span class="extra">O</span></span>logy unless<br>I give you some clue<span class="color">C</span> that you can address.</p>
		<p style="text-align:center">The first st<span class="color">Y</span>p you’ll probably find not intense.<br>Does a module make <span class="color">C</span>his sequence make sense?</p>
		<p style="text-align:center">This is seeming s<span class="color">K</span> w<span class="clue-phrase">R<span class="extra">Y</span></span>!<span class="clue-phrase"> O ME, O</span> my!<br>You should stay with the poem to keep <span class="color">C</span>eeling fly.</p>
		<p style="text-align:center">The the<span class="clue-phrase">M<span class="extra">E</span> I KE</span>ep finding as like<span class="color">R</span>y apparent;<br>Be aware wh<span class="color">G</span>re things are and the rest is transparent.</p>
		<p style="text-align:center">A le<span class="color">K</span>ter like this we find often exciting,<br>but its home is the fea<span class="color">B</span>ure you should be highlighting.</p>
		<p style="text-align:center">You’re making good progr<span class="color">M</span>ss! Don’t let yourself fall!<br>What you have <span class="color">C</span>ight now is not quite yet all.</p>
		<p style="text-align:center">The long yarn-like <span class="color">G</span>ubstance from a programmer’s hives<br>Exis<span class="color">C</span> with restrictions of a six and two fives.</p>
		<p style="text-align:center">What you’ve c<span class="color">R</span>vered already? That’s just the start!<br>Keep <span class="color">C</span>arreling forward and you’ve got the part!</p>
		<p style="text-align:center">In your restrictions you hav<span class="color">K</span> two of the same.<br>I<span class="color">C</span> they didn’t start similarly, that would be lame.</p>
		<p style="text-align:center">Hopefully now you should have your fa<span class="color">R</span>r share<br>of some interesting thi<span class="color">K</span>gs; from each, take a pair.</p>
		<p style="text-align:center">The rest may be obvious, but to cross that bor<span class="color">K</span>er,<br>put the remainder in alphabet<span class="color">C</span>cal order.</p>
		<p style="text-align:center">If it does<span class="color">W</span>’t make sense now, you might just be sickly.<br>The puzzle based on a <span class="color">C</span>ame has now been solved quickly.</p>
		<p>After following Simon Sends rules, we get 3 positions in the poem. Next we must add the next 4 more characters to two of these positions and 5 more to the third (explained in stanza 8). These give 3 NATO characters with one additional letter, creating 3 pairs of letters. Looking at the pairs in alphabetical order (stanza 12) provides the answer.</p>
